"J&K police arrest 5, including stepmother of slain nine-year-old Uri girl, for rape, murder",2018-09-04T23:10:23+05:30,"SRINAGAR: Police claimed on Tuesday they had solved what appeared to be Jammu and Kashmir’s most horrific crime — the  , murder and mutilation of a nine-year-old girl from  , Uri — and had arrested all the five accused, including the child’s stepmother, half-brother and their friends.

 
 Police said a combination of sustained interrogation and forensic and medical examinations led them to believe the girl had been gang-raped, strangled, struck with an axe, had her eyes gouged out and acid poured over her because, allegedly, her stepmother had been jealous that her husband lavished attention and love on his children from his second wife.
 
 According to the police spokesman, Boniyar police station had received a written complaint last week from the murdered girl’s father, of Trikanjan, Uri, that his daughter was missing and that he feared she may have been abducted. “On receipt of this complaint, a case under FIR No 43/2018, under RPC Section 363, was registered at police station Boniyar and investigation was taken up,” police said, adding that the girl could not be traced despite their best efforts.
 
 “During the course of investigation, the statement of the father of the girl was recorded and it was found that he has two wives, one from a local village, Trikanjan, and another, from Jharkhand. The missing girl was the daughter of the non-local mother. He also stated that the stepmother would mostly work outside the home, grazing goats in nearby fields, while the non-local wife would mostly stay at home to cook food, etc.,” police added.
 
 “On September 2, the missing girl’s decomposing body was found in a forest about a km from her home. Police teams, including Uri SDPO Mehrajudin Raina and Boniyar SHO Iqbal Ahmad, then accompanied the forensic and medical teams to the spot and examined the crime scene,” police said.
 
 Examination of the crime scene and circumstances thereof led to suspicions of murder and an investigation was begun in this direction, the police spokesman said. “A special investigation team (SIT) headed by the Uri SDPO was constituted to investigate the murder. Sustained questioning by the SIT of the stepmother of the murdered girl and other suspects revealed the bone-chilling account of the murder and rape of the nine-year-old child,” police claimed.
 
 Police alleged it was found that the stepmother had for long been jealous of her husband’s wife from Jharkhand and her children as she believed her husband was more affectionate towards his second wife and the children born of her than her (the stepmother) and her children.
 
 “During questioning, she also revealed that her husband would mostly spend time with his second wife and his (now deceased) daughter was dearest to him among all his children,” police claimed, adding that the acrimonious atmosphere, primarily caused by the father taking a second wife, had been worsening.
 
 “The stepmother hence hatched a conspiracy to eliminate her stepdaughter. Armed with a sharp knife, she took her stepdaughter to the nearby jungle. While she was on the way to the forest, she signalled her son (half-brother of the deceased), aged about 14 years, to be ready for the commission of the crime,” police claimed.
 
 The half-brother and two of his friends — Kaiser Ahmad (19), and another 14-year-old boy — later joined the stepmother in the forest. “One more accused, Naseer Ahmad Khan, alias Guddo, aged 28 years, also joined in the commission of the crime,” police claimed.
 
 “On reaching the spot, the girl was gang-raped by the accused in the presence of, and at the instance of, her stepmother. It was Kaiser who first raped her, and then the others, including her half-brother, took turns raping the girl,” police said.
 
 ""Thereafter the stepmother strangled the girl and her half-brother struck her on the head hit with an axe, killing her on the spot. After that, one of the accused, believed to be a minor, went home and brought back acid in a bottle from stock meant for the maintenance of vehicle batteries.
 
 “Kaiser gouged out her eyes with a sharp knife and then acid was sprinkled on her body. Physical condition and preliminary forensic analysis of the body substantiate all these facts. Finally, Kaiser and Naseer dumped the body in the bushes and covered it with twigs and branches from pine trees,” police alleged.
 
 Police added that all the material and weapons of offence, including the axe and knife, had been recovered at the instance of the accused. “Also, the plastic can containing the acid has been recovered. All the accused have been arrested. The case will be soon be charge-sheeted for judicial determination,” police added.

"Minimum compensation for rape Rs 4 lakh, rules SC",2018-09-06T05:11:30+05:30,"NEW DELHI: In an order applicable nationally, the   has ruled that a rape survivor will get a mandatory minimum compensation of Rs 4 lakh and, in case of gang rape Rs 5 lakh, and directed states to implement this from October 2 in accordance with a scheme framed by the National Legal Services Authority ( ) in consultation with the Centre.

 
 At present, different state governments grant varying amounts of compensation to rape survivors, ranging from Rs 10,000 in Odisha to Rs 10 lakh in Goa. Some states have not framed any rule. The lack of a uniform scheme for compensation meant many rape survivors fail to get compensation and this led to the apex court’s intervention and a scheme that seeks to ameliorate the mental and physical hurt.
 
 The monetary relief granted under the “compensation scheme for women victims/survivors of sexual assault and other crimes 2018” is not linked with trial proceedings in such cases and the survivor can approach the state or district legal services authority for compensation immediately after registration of FIR. The scheme empowers legal services authority to take suo motu cognisance of cases of sexual assault and acid attack to grant interim relief to survivors.
 
 As the Centre has not framed rules for compensation of minor rape survivors under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur, S Abdul Nazeer and Deepak Gupta said the NALSA scheme will be applicable in these cases till norms are framed. 
 
 As per the scheme, a minimum Rs 5 lakh is to be paid in case of loss of life or gang rape and maximum has been fixed at Rs 10 lakh. A minimum of Rs 4 lakh is to be paid in case of rape or unnatural sexual assault. In case of victims of burning and acid attacks, minimum compensation will be Rs 7 lakh for total disfigurement and Rs 5 lakh in case of 50% burns. It says Rs 1 lakh shall be paid within 15 days to an acid attack victim and thereafter Rs 2 lakh within two months.
 
 “As soon as the application for compensation is received by the SLSA/DLSA, a sum of Rs 5,000 or, as the case warrants, up to Rs 10,000 shall be immediately disbursed to the victim by the secretary of DLSA or member secretary of SLSA,” the scheme said. Interestingly, the scheme says if a woman survivor is subject to more than one crime, she will be entitled for a combined value of compensation. It means when a gang rape victim dies her family members will be entitled to a minimum Rs 10 lakh — Rs 5 lakh for loss of life and Rs 5 lakh for gang rape.
 
 In case a trial or appellate court finds that the criminal complaint and allegations were false, the LSA will initiate proceedings for recovery of compensation, if any, granted in part or full. The   directed the Centre to give the scheme wide publicity on all media platforms to create awareness about the social welfare scheme and pave way for victims to claim the right to compensation. A compensation fund will be set up and it will be managed by State Legal Services Authority. It also envisages setting up a portal for online applications.

"Step-mother masterminds 9-year-old’s rape, murder",2018-09-05T13:54:39+05:30,"SRINAGAR: Police claimed on Tuesday that they had solved what appeared to be Jammu and Kashmir’s most horrific crime in recent times — the  , murder and mutilation of a nine-year-old girl from Boniyar, Uri. They said all five accused, including the child’s stepmother and halfbrother, had been arrested.

 
 Police said sustained interrogation and forensic and medical examinations led them to believe the girl had been gangraped, strangled, struck with an axe, had her eyes gouged out and acid poured over her because, allegedly, her stepmother was jealous that her husband lavished attention and love on his children from his second wife. Boniyar police received a complaint last week from a person who identified himself as X (TOI is withholding his name) of Uri, that his daughter was missing and that he feared she may have been abducted. An FIR was then filed and investigation started, police said, adding that the girl could not be traced despite their best efforts.
 
 The police found in the course of their investigation that the man had two wives — a local woman called A, and another from Jharkhand called B (both names withheld). The missing girl was B’s daughter. X also told the police that A would mostly work outdoors, grazing goats in nearby fields, while B mostly stayed at home to cook food, etc. “On September 2, the missing girl’s decomposing body was found in a forest about a kilometre from her home. Police teams, led by Uri SDPO Mehrajudin Raina and Boniyar SHO Iqbal Ahmad, accompanied forensic and medical teams to the spot and examined the crime scene,” police said.
 
 Examination of the crime scene led to suspicions of murder and an investigation was launched, the police said. “A special investigation team (SIT) headed by the Uri SDPO was set up. Sustained questioning of the stepmother and other suspects revealed the bone-chilling crime,” police said.
 
 Police alleged that the stepmother had for long been jealous of her husband’s other wife and her children as she believed he was more affectionate towards them.
 
 “During questioning, A revealed that her husband would mostly spend time with B and that his daughter (now deceased) was his dearest,” police claimed, adding that the acrimonious atmosphere, primarily caused by X taking a second wife, had been worsening. “A hence hatched a conspiracy to eliminate her stepdaughter. Armed with a sharp knife, she took her stepdaughter to a nearby  . While she was on the way to the forest, she signalled her son (halfbrother of the deceased), aged about 14 years, to be ready for the crime,” police claimed.
 
 The half-brother and two of his friends — Kaiser Ahmad (19), son of Sikander Mir, and another 14-year-old boy — later joined A in the forest. “One more accused, Naseer Ahmad Khan, alias Guddo, aged 28 years, son of Sher Zaman Khan of Lari, Trikanjan, also joined in the commission of the crime,” police claimed.

 The court of additional district and sessions judge Poonam R Joshi, in its judgment, said this case is a classic example of the phrase, “the city peaceful has become unsafe”. “A woman who steps out to earn her livelihood has become a victim of persons running a public transport in which the entire public has full faith. The incident had made every woman staying in Chandigarh to think uncountable number of times as to whether she should step out after sunset even if she has a very important task. The incident had sent shivers not only down the spine of the females but the city as a whole,” the judgment said.
 
  
 Pointing out that it’s high time for Chandigarh Police to keep check on autos and other public transport vehicles, the judgment stated cops need to act instead of just boasting. The judgement stated, “The capital of two states boast of excellent, police patrolling and management, but this incident has sent shivers down the spine of not only residents of the city but the county as a whole. Autos are going unchecked in the city. It is high time the police look into the matter and keep a check on all autos and other public transport plying in the city so that such untoward incidents are not repeated.”

The judgment stated the convicts had used sympathy factor to win the confidence of the woman.
 
 
 
 
 Irfan indulged into talking with her when she boarded the auto and told her that his daughter is paralyzed. Irfan also called the victim “beti”, the judgment stated. “The entire set of circumstances show that accused tried to win over the victim by telling stories about his paralytic daughter. The accused were aware about the vulnerability of females and he started telling such a story of his daughter,” the judgment said.
 
 Stating that the convicts deserve no leniency, the court said, “Unfortunate are the mothers who have given birth to such beasts and kept them close to their bosom with the hope that they will be saviours of their future.”

Two minors raped in separate incidents,2018-09-04T03:13:00+05:30,"Nagpur: Two rape cases, both against minors, have been reported at Jaripatka and Nandanwan police stations in the last 24 hours. In both cases, cops have booked the accused under sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. In the first incident, a girl was allegedly raped by her tuition teacher, who promised to marry her, between August and November last year. Kishor Hood, the accused, taught the survivor chemistry at a private institute located at Patankar Square. The survivor is currently a second year BSc student, and was a minor at the time of the incident.

According to the cops, the survivor of the first case joined the institute in 2015 when she was in Std XI. In 2016, all the students, along with teachers, went for a picnic near Warud, where the survivor “praised” Hood’s personality. The accused then tried to get close to the girl who declined his marriage proposal. However, Hood continued to pursue her by promising a better life. In August 2017, Kishor took the survivor to a lodge at Sitabuldi and allegedly exploited her. He raped her again at his rented house in Ayodhya Nagar and in Bhandara, while on a trip. Kishor, who is married and has a child, had promised to divorce his wife and marry the survivor. The girl finally complained to the police when the accused did not keep his promises.

Katy Perry denies Dr. Luke raped her,2018-08-28T15:31:58+05:30,"Singer   has denied she was raped by  , according to a deposition unsealed on Monday from the ongoing legal battle between Luke and  .

 
 
 
 In court documents obtained, Perry's deposition from July 21, 2017, revealed that the singer, 33, repeatedly shut down the allegation that was made public as part of his defamation suit against Kesha, who accused him of raping her.
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 The producer's legal team previously accused Kesha of circulating the rumour that he raped Perry.
 
 ""The false narrative Kesha created about being raped became widely accepted, damaging Dr. Luke's reputation irreparably. Compounding this malicious act, in 2016, Kesha told   that Dr. Luke raped Katy Perry, which is outrageous and untrue,"" Dr. Luke's attorneys said in the statement on Monday.
 
 ""Katy Perry testified under oath in this case that Dr. Luke never raped her. Regardless, Kesha refused to apologize. Instead, she issued a press release which again irresponsibly suggested that Katy Perry was actually raped by Dr. Luke. It seems that Kesha wanted to perpetuate the falsehood that Dr. Luke raped Katy Perry,"" the statement said.
 
 In her response, also issued on Monday, Kesha denied making such claims.
 
 ""With regard to Dr. Luke's claim that Kesha defamed him by falsely stating he also assaulted Katy Perry, Kesha has never claimed to have any independent knowledge of any alleged assault of Katy Perry (which Ms. Perry has denied in a later deposition),"" Kesha's attorneys said.
 
 ""But, to be clear, Dr. Luke is suing Kesha based on a private, one-on-one text message that Kesha sent Lady Gaga in 2016, shortly after Interscope CEO   told Kesha and Lady Gaga he'd heard a rumour that Dr. Luke had also abused Katy Perry. Mr. Janick's statement was discussed privately between the two friends and would never have become public, except that Dr. Luke decided to publish it to millions of people in his 2017 complaint against Kesha. This defamation claim, based on a private text message which was based on the statement of a third party, is also frivolous.""
 
 Meanwhile, Gaga confirmed Janick's conversation in her deposition.
 
 ""He said he had heard a rumour. I don't recall exactly the way he said it. I just recall that it was brought up. He said something like I heard (Dr. Luke) raped Katy (Perry), too,"" Gaga said.

HC refers rape convict’s plea for parole to CJ,2018-08-29T03:41:00+05:30,"Nagpur: Whether a rape convict can get parole as per amended Maharashtra Prisons (Bombay Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959? The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court referred this question to the Chief Justice for placing it before the larger bench. A division bench comprising Justice Ravi Deshpande and Justice Arun Upadhye sought to know, “Whether Rule 4 (13) creating an absolute bar to claim release on furlough and consequently Rule 19(2)(B)(i) to claim release on parole to the rape convict, is violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, particularly when the offenders in other serious offences are entitled to such leave?” The decision came while hearing a plea by rape convict Vijay Pralhad Varankar, currently serving 10-year term in Amravati Central Jail after he was found guilty under sections 376(2)(a) and 342 of IPC. He had already undergone five years sentence before applying for parole. After examining his case, the jail authorities allowed his proposal for parole, but the commissioner rejected it citing amendments made under Rule 4(b) (13) read with Rule 19(2)(B)(i) of furlough and parole, introduced via August 26, 2016 notification, which he challenged. The petitioner relied on Supreme Court judgment in Ashfaq versus state of Rajasthan last year, where it was held that conviction in a serious and heinous crime can’t be the reason for denying parole. Additional public prosecutor AM Joshi quoted HC division bench’s decision in case of Sharad Shelake versus state of Maharashtra, reported in 2016, where the validity of similar such Rule 4 (13) of the Rules of 1959, was upheld. In this case, HC relied on apex court’s verdict in case of state of Haryana versus Jai Singh (reported in 2003). HC held in categorical terms that the classification created for imposing bar to grant parole/furlough based on nature of offences is a valid one for purpose of deciding whether the persons, who committed such offences, should be granted remission. Justices Deshpande and Upadhye observed that in Shelake’s case, the question involved was of rejection of furlough on the ground that petitioner was convicted for kidnapping, in respect of which, Rule 4 (13) created a bar for releasing him. The SC decision in Jai Singh’s case was on the question of remission in sentence. It may be possible to make the distinction between creating a bar for grant of remission covered in Jai Singh’s case and for grant of parole in Shelake’s case. “We’re of the view that Shelake’s case decision runs contrary to the SC’s decision in Ashfaq’s case. We, therefore, think that the judicial propriety and discipline requires us to refer the matter to a larger bench instead of making out a distinction between the contrary decisions of SC and HC. Similarly, it would also not be proper on our part to hold that the HC’s decision in Shelake’s case stands impliedly overruled by the SC’s decision in Ashfaq's case,” the judges said, before directing its registry to refer the plea to the CJ."

 Initially, the case was registered under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 which has a provision of providing compensation to the victim's family. 
 
 But, later, it came to the fore that the accused also belonged to the same caste, after which the SC/ST Act was not applicable in the case. The SC/ST prevention of atrocity Act (1989) does not come into play when the accused also belong to the same caste. 
 
 The 12-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly kidnapped and raped in a remote village of Uttarkashi. Her body was found on August 18. 
 
 The brutality of the incident had outraged the locals who held a series of protests in Garhwal region forcing the police to suspend the internet services. The district police nabbed the culprit, Mukesh Lal, who also confessed his crime on August 22.
 
 Legal experts were of the view that in such unique cases, the state laws of compensation should prevail. 
 
 ""On compassionate grounds, the compensation must be given under the state laws without waiting for the conclusion of the court's order on compensation,"" said Suneet Singh Aulakh, a lawyer.

 However, police had last week claimed that the school principal and the girl’s class teacher had been booked on charges of criminal intimidation, cruelty and sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act in connection with the rape of the child, allegedly by a swimming pool lifeguard of the school.
 
 “The contents of the report established that the action of the school management and the principal was only civil in nature,” district magistrate Brajesh Narain Singh told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 “Anyway, the inquiry is still incomplete as a response from the school is awaited on the findings of the report. We have given fifteen days to them to respond to the allegations. There response is awaited,” he added.
 
 TOI had earlier reported that the committee constituted by the DM to look into the security lapses in the school had found multiple lacunae in the safety parameters, including lack of monitoring of CCTV footage from 168 cameras in the campus, as many as 19 employees working on visitor cards, lack of proper I-cards, single health check-up of students in a year, medicines register not being maintained etc.
 
 Parents who had been demanding justice for the child and action against the principal for trying to hide the facts, are a disappointed lot.
 
 “The principal had tried to save the accused initially as she vouched for his character. The district administration wants to save the school and it is clear from the way the inquiry report has been handled,” said a parent.

"US woman’s rape: 3 years on, court frames charges",2018-08-29T06:50:11+05:30,"CHANDIGARH: Three years after a US national was allegedly gangraped by an autorickshaw driver and his friend in April 2015, a court here on Tuesday framed charges against the accused.

 
 The charges were framed even as the defence counsel raised objections to the move, saying that the complainant had not recorded her statement in front of a magistrate and the police also not carried out a test-identification parade of the accused, Ludhiana resident Baldev Kumar.
 
 His accomplice is yet to be arrested. The case’s trial will start on September 17. Defence advocate Meenu Jajoria argued that this was the first case where prosecution had nothing in hand and still charges were framed.
 
 The court had allowed the police on March 19 this year to record the statement of the survivor and conduct the identification parade of the accused through video conferencing by coordinating with the US embassy in India. However, the exercise is still pending as the magistrate has written to the Punjab and Haryana high court to know the procedure for involving the embassy in the matter, but its reply is pending.
 
 The charges under which Kumar has been framed are: sections 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement), 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage) 376 (rape ), 392 (robbery), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the  .
 
 The woman had visited India on a tourist visa. She was scheduled to go to Europe tour later and left the country less than a week after the crime was committed without registering a complaint and reached France. From there, she sent an online complaint to the then Chandigarh IG, R P Upadhaya. The woman had sent her complaint through email from France in August.
 
 An investigation was conducted and an FIR was registered at the Sector 17 police station in February 2016. As per the compliant ,the victim had stated that she was standing near the ISBT, Sector 17, when some auto drivers surrounded her. In the meantime, a man from Kurukshetra in Haryana, who was sitting in Baldev’s auto, approached her and asked if she had any problem. The woman told him that she needed a hotel room to spend the night, following which he asked Baldev to get her one. The auto-driver took her to several hotels but she failed to get an accommodation. Later, Baldev allegedly convinced her to accompany him to his friend’s house in Kharar where she could stay for the night. Baldev and his friend then raped the US tourist.

In this case, the rape survivor was a minor girl, aged about 12 years at the time of incident. She was raped by her stepfather. The measure of punishment in a case of rape cannot depend on the social status of the victim or the accused. It must depend on the conduct of the accused, the state and age of the victim and gravity of the criminal act.”
 
 “Crimes of violence upon women or children need to be severely dealt with. The convict does not deserve to live in civilized society. Decency and morality in public and social life can be protected only if courts deal strictly with those who violate the social norms,” the court added.

"After 28 years, Supreme Court acquits 2 of gang rape",2018-08-31T01:07:06+05:30,"NEW DELHI: A woman’s   complaint against two men failed the Supreme Court’s scrutiny 28 years after the alleged incident, leading to the acquittal of the duo, who were sentenced to 10 years by the   as well as the  .

 
 After tortuous proceedings in the three-tier judicial system spanning close to three decades, the SC found that the lower court and the HC ignored gaping holes in the prosecution’s evidence and its inability to prove the crime. What in particular swung the case against the complainant was the finding about her husband being unaware of the atrocity allegedly committed on her.
 
 The woman, it was found from the cross-examination and testimonies, had a fight with the two men and accused them of rape out of vengeance in 1990.
 
 She alleged that the evening after the fight, the men had dragged her to a field by the side of a busy road where a weekly market was in progress.
 
 She claimed that she had confided in her husband about the sexual assault and had gone to the police station around 11am the next day to lodge an FIR. She had alleged that her petticoat was stained with semen and that she had sustained bruises.
 
 
 
 A bench of Justices N V Ramana and Mohan M Shantanagoudar found on Wednesday from the forensic test report that the petticoat had no trace of semen and the medical report found no injuries on the woman’s body except a half-centimetre bruise on her cheek. This bruise alone was not sufficient to establish rape, it said.
 
 The husband attested to his wife’s fight with the two accused.
 
 With regard to the rape, however, he deposed that while he had accompanied his wife to the police station a day after the alleged sexual assault, he had no knowledge of the complaint filed by her.
 
 The two men were sentenced to 10 years by the lower court in 1992 and this was upheld by the HC in 2017. The duo spent two years in jail.
 
 Writing the judgment acquitting the accused, Justice Shantanagoudar said the husband’s deposition did not support the woman’s version.
 
 “There is no reason why the husband of the victim would contradict her version. The evidence of the victim/prosecutrix and her husband are unreliable and untrustworthy inasmuch as they are not credible witnesses...,” he said.
 
 “We cannot resist putting on record that the prosecution has tried to rope in the appellants (accused) merely on assumptions, surmises and conjectures...,” the bench added. “We are of the clear opinion that the prosecutrix apparently had a motive to seek revenge against the accused persons. 
 
 The testimony of the victim in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case needs to be discarded since her testimony is a result of seeking revenge and her evidence is not free from blemish,” the bench said.

 Police said on Thursday they had booked Piyush, a 22-year-old student of a private university, based on a complaint filed by the girl’s mother, under sections of the POCSO Act. The girl studies in a wellknown CBSE school. 
 
 Child welfare committee chief   Dhull said the girl and the youth knew each other and had connected on   three months ago. She said he had raped her twice before Wednesday. CWC members met the girl for a counselling session. 
 
 Piyush, who lives in the same Sector 84 society, has not been arrested yet. Police said he had fled his first-floor flat, where he lived with his elder brother, after he became aware of the complaint. The basement where the alleged rape happened is not covered by CCTV cameras.
 
 
 
 The sprawling society, spread over 23 acres, is only partially complete but 300 families already live in six of the 13 towers that have been delivered to buyers.
 
  ACP (crime against women-south) Shakuntala   said the girl had gone down to the basement to play on Wenesday afternoon and it appeared Piyush was already present there. According to her mother’s statement, he took the 11-year-old by force to a corner and raped her. “The medical report of the girl has confirmed rape and a case has been registered,” said Yadav, adding she had visited the basement and interacted with the girl as well as her family members. 
 
 The case was registered late on Wednesday. Other residents of the society said Piyush’s parents, who live in another part of the city, had tried to intervene after the girl’s family raised an alarm and attempts were made to dissuade the girl’s family from filing a complaint. Police did not comment on this but said the case was registered late in the night on Wednesday at the women’s police station in   after the girl’s mother filed a complaint. 
 
 Police have also spoken to Piyush’s parents. “We have asked the parents of the accused to produce him before police or else police will do as appropriate,” said Yadav. The girl’s family moved into a 15th-floor flat in the society around 18 months ago and the parents work from home. Piyush had been living in a first-floor rented flat for the last three months. In her statement to the police, the girl’s mother said her daughter had gone to the basement on Wednesday to play, like any other day. “On her return home, she shared her ordeal with us,” she said in the complaint, adding it was essential to take strict action against the youth as his presence was a threat to the safety of other children in the society as well. The common basement is spread over a 1lakh square feet area and most parking slots are vacant. “Most parts of the basement remain empty and in corners, building material and other stuff is stowed. There are certain corners in the basement that are completely isolated,” said a resident who did not wish to be named, adding it was possible for one to go unnoticed there. The condominium was launched in 2008 and was supposed to be completed by 2011. Possession in completed towers was given from mid-2016. “People started moving into the society from October 2016,” said a resident, adding the guards regularly take rounds of the basement. Police have also quizzed the guards. 
 
 Divya Vaishnava, director Bachche-Unki Duniya Foundation, who works with Gurugram police, said she will interact with the girl on Friday. “A child’s safety in a community is everyone’s responsibility. I emphasise the role of families and neighborhood support when it comes to child protection. Let’s focus on how we can create safe communities for our children without restricting their natural movements,” she said.

The girl told the mother that when she entered the school gate, a boy forcibly took her to the watchmen’s toilet where he blindfolded her and sexually assaulted her. The girl’s mother then lodged a complaint. A police officer said, “The child seems to be in trauma and has been changing her statements. 
 
 It is yet to be ascertained whether she was sexually assaulted on the school premises or some other place.” The officer said that the girl initially claimed she was assaulted in the toilet by an unknown boy, but later said that a stranger assaulted her when she had gone to a   stall outside the school. “We found there is no vada pav stall outside the school,” said the officer.

The notice has also been issued to complainant who had accused Dhillon of making her a drug addict and raping her.
 
 They have been told to file replies on the contentions raised by Dhillon by September 28.
 
 In his plea, Dhillon has alleged that the inquiry into the allegations against him was concluded by Punj in a haste on a single day without recording the statements of the individuals mentioned in the FIR.
 
 Counsel for the petitioner, advocate G K Mann argued that the petitioner was an international hockey player and brought many laurels to the country, and infact was recruited in the police force in 1993 on the strength of his sports credentials.
 
 Mann submitted that the petitioner was posted at   from November 2015 to March 2017 as deputy superintendent of police (DSP). “During his tenure at Kapurthala, Gurjit Singh Rana, asked him for undue favours on many occasions, which the petitioner refused and as a result he was humiliated.

In order to avoid embarrassment to his party, Rana, surreptitiously and with ill intent sent the complainant to the then leader of opposition   and Simranjit Singh Bains with a brief to flare up the issue to further implicate the petitioner,” the court was told.
 
 Later, the woman made a complaint to the Ludhiana commissioner of police with allegations of rape against Dhillon and an inquiry was marked to Punj to submit a report within a week.
 
 The counsel for the petitioner told the HC that Punj carried out a farcical inquiry on June 30, 2018, and concluded it on the same day in a slipshod manner, without joining any of the persons mentioned in the FIR.
 
 Even the petitioner was not joined in the inquiry and a report was sent through a special number on July 1, which was a Sunday, argued the counsel seeking directions for probe by an officer of the rank of ADGP.

It is learnt that the team is of the strong view that the bishop should be summoned to the state, instead.

 
 The investigation team is confident that they have got sufficient evidence to take the bishop into custody which will eventually lead to his arrest, said a source close to the team.
 
 The probe team had confirmed that the claim of the bishop that he was in a convent of the diocese in   on the day the nun had said that she was abused for the first time by him in the   convent is a lie. The investigation team lead by Vaikom DSP K Subhash had gone straight to the convent in Thodupuzha to seize the records there, after returning from Jalandhar.
 
 According to sources, there are over 20 contradictions in the statement given by the bishop and this itself will make his arrest inevitable. The driver who dropped the bishop in the convent on the day the nun had alleged that she was abused by him has also become crucial in the investigation.
 
 Since the recording of the bishop's statement in Jalandhar was video-recorded, if he makes and change in his stand in future interrogation, it will only go against him.
 
 Meanwhile, the probe team is also not ruling out the possibility of more complaints coming up against the bishop in the coming days.

"‘Room’ all over again: Man keeps teenage girl locked up for 3 months, rapes and tortures her",2018-08-26T03:46:44+05:30,"GURUGRAM: A 16-year-old girl was kept in confinement in a  , cut off from the rest of the world, for three months and sexually assaulted almost every day of her captivity by a 25-year-old private security guard, who she knew from a housing society in Gurugram’s Palam Vihar where they both worked.

 
 He took away her cellphone, and visited once every day with food and groceries. The room was always locked from outside. To keep her quiet, he drugged her, putting sedatives in her food and water. In case that didn’t work, he tortured and thrashed her, just so that lived in a perpetual state of fear.
 
 Between May and last week, the chilling story of ‘Room’ — the 2010 novel and subsequently Oscar-winning movie about a woman in the US being held captive in a garden shed by a man for seven years — became the reality of a teenager who had come with her parents to Gurugram looking for work, lost her way and ended up in the hands of a predator. The teenager’s captivity may have been much longer — her parents had lodged a kidnapping case in Bengal in May and recently returned to Gurugram resigned to not seeing their daughter again — if not for a stroke of luck.
 
 On the evening of August 22 (last Wednesday), her captor Mohammad Aalam Manjar forgot to lock the room as he made a brief errand for groceries. The teenager sensed her opportunity and ran. She managed to make contact with her parents. Late on Friday night (August 24), Manjar was picked up by a police team from his house. That was in Chauma as well, in the same neighborhood as the ‘room’, a house where Manjar lived a parallel life with his wife.
 
 Manjar was produced in court on Saturday and sent to judicial custody. An FIR has been registered at Bajghera police station under sections 323 (causing hurt) and 344 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC, and sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The teenager has been admitted to hospital. Police are waiting for her medical report. She told police her family had been living in Gurugram for several years and she and her mother had been working as domestic helps at homes to earn a livelihood. Manjar knew her and her parents well. In the first week of May, the girl and her parents went home to Bengal. A few days later, on May 13, Manjar reached Bengal too and arranged a meeting with the girl. It’s not clear yet what he told her but she agreed to return to Gurugram with him. Thus began her captivity, in a room Manjar rented at Chauma in New Palam Vihar. They reached Delhi by train.
 
 When her parents later contacted Manjar, he feigned ignorance. The parents had no reason to suspect him and searched in places in Bengal for their daughter. Earlier this month, having lost hope of finding her, they returned to Gurugram.
 
 In her statement to the police, the girl said, “He held me captive in a room and snatched my mobile phone. He sedated me using a cold drink and raped me. After this, he visited every day, raped me and sedated me again. He thrashed me if I resisted.” Investigating officer Mukesh Kumari said Manjar, who is originally from Kishengunj in Bihar, had admitted to the crime. “He said he kept his wife in the dark by saying he was working extra hours when she asked why he came home late every day and sometimes stayed away for two-three days.”

 To make the proposed law palatable to the opposition, a provision of bail for the accused from a magistrate has been added. The amendments to the bill, cleared by the Union Cabinet recently, also has the provision for settlement between the husband and the wife.
 
 The FIR can now only be lodged by the victim, her blood relations and those who have become her relatives by virtue of her marriage. Others, like neighbours, cannot lodge an FIR to prevent misuse of the proposed law.
 
 In his address, the prime minister also referred to the performance of both Houses of Parliament, saying whenever a discussion on Parliament is held, it is about hold-ups, noisy scenes and stalling of proceedings.
 
 ""But when something good happens, it is not given much importance. The Monsoon Session of Parliament ended just a few days back. You will be glad to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha remained 118 per cent and that of Rajya Sabha -- 74 per cent. All the members rose above party interests to make the Monsoon Session most productive and this is why the Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and Rajya Sabha 14,"" he said.
 
 He said the recently-concluded session will always be remembered as a ""session for social justice and youth welfare"".
 
 Modi pointed out that a number of important bills beneficial to the youth and the backward classes were passed during the session, including he one to grant constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes.
 
 ""This step will prove to be the one to move forward our march towards achieving the goal of social justice,"" he said.
 
 He also referred to a bill which overturned a Supreme Court order putting in place safeguards in a law on atrocities against SCs and STs.
 
 ""This Act will give more security to the interests of SC and ST communities. This will also forbid criminals from indulging in atrocities and will instill confidence among the dalit communities,"" the prime minister said.

 The girl, who is under observation in hospital, told TOI she remembers little of the horror she lived through during the three months of her captivity, in a room in which the guard confined her. She fears she is pregnant — her medical reports are awaited — and said she would rather blank out the   by terminating her pregnancy, in case the reports are positive.
 
 The child welfare committee (CWC) is yet to take the girl’s consent in the matter, but officials say she can abort as her pregnancy is expected to be under 20 weeks. It’s some time in May that she was abducted but the girl said she does not remember the date, or how she came to be in the room. Her parents, who had moved to Gurugram several years ago, were visiting their village in West Bengal when the guard, Mohammed Aalam Manjar, a 25-year-old married man, started preying on her.
 
 “I had gone to the market, in my village in West Bengal, with my friends. After we shopped, they went to tuition, and I headed back for home. At the time, somebody covered my face from behind and the cloth was possibly laced with something as I immediately fell unconscious,” she recalled.
 
 She knows she was brought to Gurugram by road, which is different from Manjar’s account that they came by train, but can’t remember whether she arrived by car or bus. Because of the extent to which her mind had become benumbed, as a result of continuous sedation for three months, it felt as if everything that had happened was enveloped in a haze, she said.
 
 She knows the room was near the railway crossing in New Palam Vihar. “The neighbours were told we have been married for a year now. So, they had no reason to doubt our cohabitation. He wasn’t there all the time (but) visited me regularly. He would come with food and water which was spiked, I think. He would   me and leave me in a drugged state. Whenever I was conscious enough to resist, he hit me till I was unconscious again,” she recounted.
 
 Her account of how she escaped was different from what police had said on Friday. Manjar, she said, hadn’t visited her for two-three days, and the effects of the drugs wore off one morning. She managed to shout and reach out to a neighbour. She escaped from the room on August 22. 
 
 On asking the neighbour she was, she received a reply, “Faatak ke paar, Palam Vihar” (across the railway tracks in Palam Vihar).
 
 “I realised I am in Gurugram and knew where my parents lived. I told the neighbour that I’m heading out for some work and will be back in a few minutes. I couldn’t risk telling her that I am escaping. I left and reached my parents’ place. Luckily, they were there and rescued me,” she said. 
 
 The police had said on Friday she had capitalised on a lucky break when Manjar had forgotten to bolt the door. The girl, in her own words, struggles to remember exact events clearly.
 
 Following a police complaint, Manjar was arrested and the girl was admitted to the General Hospital in Civil Lines. “It is all a long nightmare to me which will become a reality if I have this baby. It will be a constant reminder of what I want to forget. I want an abortion,” she said.
 
 As per the rules, any termination of pregnancy requires counselling by a government appointed counsellor and, also, consent from a medical board. “Legally, she is less than 20 weeks pregnant and therefore eligible for medical termination of pregnancy,” said Shakuntala Dhull, chairperson of the CWC. 
 
 “Once her medical reports come, we will talk to her on the subject, and if she wants to go ahead with the procedure, then a medical board will be constituted to examine her physical condition and perform the procedure,” Dhull added.
 
 Manjar knew the girl and her parents for years because they worked in the same housing society in Palam Vihar, she as a domestic help and he as a guard. He was arrested on Friday and is now in judicial custody.

 When police grilled Ziauddin, he told about the spot and the body was recovered, the SP said. “Ziauddin had stuffed the girl’s underwear in her mouth so that her cries could not be heard,” he said and added that forensic experts from Muzaffarpur would match the marks of slippers found on loose soil with that of the accused. “The forensic experts also took samples of the soil which was found in his nails. They also found bloodstains and fluids on his clothes,” he said.

New CP guides the students on traffic and women's dignity,,"He has taken over Nagpur’s Police Department almost three weeks ago, but the new Commissioner of Police   has already known the city for years. Having served here as SP rural and DIG prisons, the man knows the pulse of the city. Recently the   met a lot of youngsters and guided them about   rules, women's dignity and more. He also spoke about various other important issues....

 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I have already told my men to be out and about on the roads, streets and bylanes. The cops have to reach out to people and be there for them and not wait for people to come to the police station. In western countries, most of the people haven’t seen a police station; they just call the cops whenever there is an emergency. So my priority is simple - to ensure that we have people-friendly police force that is extremely visible and accessible.
 
 
 
 
 Traffic is currently one of our biggest challenges because of the ongoing metro and national highway projects. I have already put new DCP Raj Tilak on this job; we have started the process of involving the students in traffic management. After all, they are the biggest stakeholders in traffic issues. The lives of these three LAD girls who were going triple seat may have been saved had they been counselled by someone. A lot of counselling cells will soon be set up at all the colleges and schools to create more traffic-aware youngsters. Also, we are making a complete list of various bottlenecks in the city so that we can focus on tackling the traffic there.
 
 
 
 Women’s safety is one of the most important issues for me and my department. Our bharosa cell is quite active, but there are new initiatives needed to instil fresh breath of air in the whole process. I have already ordered extra patrolling in vulnerable, dark and lonely areas. Moreover, I have asked all my old sources to inform me and my department immediately if they see or hear anything that can hamper people’s safety. I also want the ladies and the common people to cooperate with us and share their problems without any fear.
 
 
 
 
 I just want to assure them that I have no bias against any law-abiding segment of the society. They are already marginalised and need a humane and sensitive approach. So, I have asked my men to treat them with the respect and dignity that they deserve, so they have nothing to fear. Here, I would like to add that LGBTQ members must also support us by informing us if any atrocities are being committed on them.
 
 
 
 As DIG prisons, I found that music, drama, theatre and poetry can bring greater balance that mere policing, so I plan to facilitate a lot of cultural events in the city and I have already started interacting with a lot of students on this front. The annual culture programme presented by the inmates of central prison in the city for the past two years is a proof that anger, stress and criminal intent – can be turned into creative energy with right motivation. This philosophy works on everyone, so this is an important armour in my hands.

Last week, additional sessions judge HC Shende found auto drivers Rajpati Nishad (28) and   (35) guilty under various sections of IPC and sentenced them to seven years' imprisonment . 

 
 Refuting the submissions of the defence that the woman's quick reporting of the incident meant she had concocted the story, the court said the victim was not an Indian national, who would think about defamation, harm to reputation and forgive those who assaulted her or molested her. 
 
 ""The victim is a brave foreigner girl who not only resisted those persons but approached the police station soon after the incident,"" the court said.
 
 The judge said that it is not an offence for a woman to travel alone at night. The woman had come to India on a tourist visa and was staying in Mumbai since September 2011. The incident took place early on December 27, 2011 when the woman was going to   from Dahisar. 
 
 On December 29, 2011, Nishad was arrested from Dahisar. Cops said the woman's passport, mobile phone and purse were recovered from him. The following month, Yadav was arrested from Uttar Pradesh. 
 
 The judge refuted the defence theory that the woman had refused to go to the first hospital for medical examination as the cops wanted a favourable report. ""There might be other reasons also like she not believing or not prepared to undergo any such examination in any unknown hospital without having any support of her near ones in the country of which she is not a citizen,"" the court observed. 
 
 The court said in a country where visitors are treated as Gods, the image has now been ruined before the world. ""The foreigners visiting our country have full faith in our country about getting warm welcome and love. The image of India is ruined/blotched before the world because of the acts of the accused persons with the lady. The crime committed by the accused, therefore, is like a stigma,"" the court said.

"‘Room’ again: Teen held captive for 3 months, raped",2018-08-26T00:41:16+05:30,"GURUGRAM: A 16-year-old girl was kept in confinement in a room, cut off from the rest of the world, for three months and sexually assaulted almost every day of her captivity by a 25-year-old private security guard, who she knew from a housing society in Gurugram’s Palam Vihar where they both worked.

 
 He took away her cellphone, and visited once every day with food and groceries. The room was always locked from outside. To keep her quiet, he drugged her food and water. In case that didn’t work, he tortured and thrashed her, just so she lived in a perpetual state of fear.
 
 Between May and last week, the chilling story of ‘Room’ — the 2010 novel and subsequently Oscar-winning movie about a woman in the US held   in a garden shed by a man for seven years —became the reality of a teen who had come with her parents to Gurugram looking for work, lost her way and ended up in the hands of a predator. The teenager’s captivity may have been much longer — her parents had lodged a kidnapping case in Bengal in May and recently returned to Gurugram resigned to not seeing their daughter again — if not for a stroke of luck.
 
 On the evening of August 22, her captor Mohammad Aalam Manjar forgot to lock the room as he made a brief errand. The teenager sensed her opportunity and ran. She managed to make contact with her parents. Late on Friday night (August 24), Manjar was picked up by a police team from his house. That was in Chauma as well, in the same neighborhood as the ‘room’, a house where Manjar lived a parallel life with his wife. Manjar was produced in court on Saturday and sent to judicial custody. An FIR has been registered at Bajghera police station under sections 323 (causing hurt) and 344 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC, and sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
 
 The teenager has been admitted to hospital. Police are waiting for her medical report. She told police her family had been living in Gurugram for several years and she and her mother had been working as domestic helps at homes to earn a livelihood. Manjar knew her and her parents well.
 
 In the first week of May, the girl and her parents went home to Bengal. A few days later, on May 13, Manjar reached Bengal too and arranged a meeting with the girl. It’s not clear yet what he told her but she agreed to return to Gurugram with him. Thus began her captivity, in a room Manjar rented at Chauma.
 
 When her parents later contacted Manjar, he feigned ignorance. The parents had no reason to suspect him and searched in places in Bengal for their daughter. In her statement to the police, the girl said, “He held me captive in a room and sedated me using a cold drink and raped me. After this, he visited every day, raped me and sedated me again. He thrashed me if I resisted.”
 
 Investigating officer Mukesh Kumari said Manjar, who is originally from Kishengunj in Bihar, had admitted to the crime. “He said he kept his wife in the dark by saying he was working extra hours when she asked why he came home late every day and sometimes stayed away for twothree days.”

 The girl is undergoing treatment at the   after being assaulted on Wednesday by a 24-year-old man, who abducted her when she was going to the public toilets. Though police arrested the accused, the protestors alleged that the real culprit was at large and the cops had arrested a wrong person.
 
 “The man who was arrested was caught while trying to abduct another minor girl. He is not the person who raped the girl, said Rangpuri resident Satish Kumar. “The trouble is the cops are not providing more information on the case.” The people demanded that police hand over the accused to them to be identified and punished.
 
 However,  , DCP (Southwest), was categorical that there was no second   of the sort and the man arrested was indeed the suspect in the rape. “There was only one call made to the police control room on Wednesday afternoon regarding the rape, and the investigating teams arrested the accused,”   reiterated.
 
 Eleven people were charged with rioting after the protestors blocked the vital road connecting areas like Vasant Kunj, Kishangarh and   with Mahipalpur and Gurgaon. Just after 7pm, traffic piled up at either end of the stretch and choked NH8. Police officers claimed that they had tried to persuade the crowd to clear the road for traffic and issued warnings as per police protocols.
 
 The residents charged police with baton charging them and forcibly evicting them from the road around 10pm. “The cops misbehaved with the women present there and even caned them. In retaliation, some people started pelting stones at the police force, leading to further violence,” Kumar maintained.
 
 For their part, the cops present on the scene reported that the villagers started hurling stones from both sides of the road, leading to injuries and damage to police vehicles. As the law and order situation spiralled out of control, the force used tear-gas shells and fired in the air to disperse the agitators. In the skirmish, two assistant commissioners of police, two   and seven other personnel suffered injuries, along with scores of the protestors. Later, a case was registered for rioting and the suspects involved in the vandalism detained at Vasant Kunj police station.
 
 The locals termed the police crackdown as harsh and uncalled, alleging that the police entered their houses and forcibly took the men away. Many people who were returning from their office were also allegedly attacked by the cops. “They broke down the doors and beat people inside their houses. Whoever was spotted by the police teams ended up being thrashed badly,” alleged a village woman.
 
 DCP Arya maintained that police only raided the houses of those suspected to have engaged in stone pelting, attacking cops and damaging vehicles. They were detained after being identified through videos of the incident.

"U’khand govt grappling with laws to give compensation to kin of raped, murdered Dalit teenager",2018-08-27T22:38:00+05:30,"Dehradun: The Uttarakhand government’s plan to provide   to the Dalit family of a teenage girl, who was allegedly raped and murdered in Uttarkashi district, has hit roadblocks. Initially, the case was registered under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 which has a provision of providing compensation to the victim’s family. But, later, it came to the fore that the accused also belonged to the same caste, after which the SC/ST Act was not applicable in the case.

 The SC/ST prevention of atrocity Act (1989) does not come into play when the accused also belong to the same caste.
 
 The 12-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly kidnapped and raped in a remote village of Uttarkashi. Her body was found on August 18. The brutality of the incident had outraged the locals who held a series of protests in Garhwal region forcing the police to suspend the internet services. The district police nabbed the culprit, Mukesh Lal, who also confessed his crime on August 22.
 
 Legal experts were of the view that in such unique cases, the state laws of compensation should prevail. “On compassionate grounds, the compensation must be given under the state laws without waiting for the conclusion of the court’s order on compensation,” said Suneet Singh Aulakh, a lawyer.
 
 “Initially, we thought of giving compensation under the SC/ST prevention of atrocity Act. But we could not as the culprit also belonged to the same caste,” DM Uttarkashi, Ashish Chauhan said.
 
 Meanwhile, the state government also explored the possibility of getting compensation from the Nirbhaya funds, but that too was untenable.
 
 “The Nirbhaya fund is not applicable when the victim is dead. So I am trying to get funds for compensation of Rs 9 lakh from the district disaster funds for both the crimes -- rape and murder,” the DM said.
 
 Meanwhile, the victim’s uncle, said: “No compensation has been given to my younger brother’s family because of this strange rule about which the district administration informed us last week.”
 
 He said that the culprit must be given death sentence for the crime he committed.

The conversation also included an instance where the woman allegedly lied to her mother about her location while moving in a car.
 
 The court also took into account the medical examination of the woman conducted at AIIMS which failed to reveal any physical injuries even though she had alleged that the accused physically assaulted her during rape.
 
 Rajender’s counsel Prashant Mehndiratta pointed out to the court that his client decided to record the conversation on a hunch. During the car journey, the alleged victim received a call from her mother. She lied to her mother that she was near Bhikaji Cama Place even though the car was in the vicinity of Kalkaji/Sarita Vihar. A police probe also revealed the cell tower location to be near Kalkaji.
 
 “Despite the petitioner clearly stating that he is ready to join investigation and is not asking for a blanket anticipatory bail, the trial court dismissed the application,” the bail plea argued, urging HC to grant some kind of protection.
 
 The woman had met Rajender through a common friend some five months prior to the incident in 2016. She claimed she had contacted the petitioner, who deals in properties, to arrange for a godown on rent in south Delhi. On the day of the incident, the woman said she was taken by Rajender in his car to several places, first for juice at a sweet shop and then to a restaurant for lunch. He then allegedly took her to a vacant plot in Badarpur and raped her.

 Additionally, in the first four months of 2018, 140 cases of sexual violence under   were registered in the Himalayan state. The registered cases under POCSO include rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment and use of children for pornography.
 
 In the latest incident, a 12-year-old girl in   of Uttarkashi was raped allegedly by a man from a nearby village who would often frequent their house. The incident saw several parts of Uttarakhand erupt in protest and the high court asking the state to form SITs in all districts to tackle such crimes and ordering trial courts to expedite judgements in such matters.
 
 The high court also asked whether the state was mulling death penalty for child rapists. Notably, earlier this year, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had said that Uttarakhand would bring a law to hang child rapists. In July, rape of an 8-year-old girl by five minor boys had sent shockwaves in Dehradun.
 
 According to Ashok Kumar, additional director general of police (law and order), majority of sexual offences against children are committed by people known to the victim or the family.
 
 Kumar, however, attributed the rise in number of reported cases to increase in awareness among public, police registering more such cases, and increase of the ambit of the legal provisions after introduction of the POCSO Act. He said that faster convictions by courts could help prevent such crimes.
 
 The latest National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) report also shows an increase in crimes, apart from sexual offences, against children in the country. According to NCRB data, police have registered 489 cases of crime against children in 2014, while the numbers increased to 676 in 2016.

 While expressing its deep concern over restraining order, the Guild wrote: “The Guild is distressed to note that the court, instead of protecting the media freedom, has issued an order that had effectively curbed it. It condemns such orders as it believes that such restrictions on reporting on investigations into a matter of public importance are counterproductive”.
 
  “The guild decries the recent growing trend of courts issuing such restraint orders on the media that undermine one of the pillar of democracy,” the Guild further wrote in its letter which was uploaded on its twitter handle.
 
 The division bench of chief justice MR Shah and Justice Ravi Ranjan retrained media from covering ongoing CBI investigation in the case until completion citing reason that it might help suspects. The high court is monitoring the entire CBI investigation.
 
 “We have also noticed that in the media, both print media as well as electronic media, the reporting is made with respect to the case and even with respect to investigation. The same may hamper the investigation very seriously,” the high court had wrote in its order.
 
 “Under the circumstances, till the investigation is completed, all the print and electronic media are hereby restrained from reporting anything with respect to the case, more particularly, with respect to the investigation already undertaken and/or which is likely to take place as it may seriously hamper the investigation of the case. The State Government as well as the CBI is directed to see that the above order is complied with by everybody,” the high court further ordered.

The other convict, Irfan, just stood motionless. The duo had raped a seven-year-old girl in Mandsaur in June after abducting her from outside her school. 

 While Asif’s brother had come to the court for the final verdict of the case, no one from either Irfan’s family or from the survivor’s family was present in the court.

 The verdict was pronounced by special judge Nisha Gupta in presence of the prosecution lawyers, defense lawyers, the two accused and Asif’s brother.
 
 The defense lawyers while arguing on the quantum of punishment, prayed to the court for not granting death sentence to the men as their age was less. However, the prosecution counsel pushed for a death penalty since the act of the accused was gruesome and heinous. 
 
 The two were awarded death penalty for   of a minor under 12 years of age, life imprisonment for attempt to murder, ten years imprisonment for kidnapping and under POCSO Act.
 
 Amidst heavy police force they were escorted back to the jail. Their act had not only risked the life of a minor, but had also instigated communal protest in Mandsaur. 
 
 Throughout the trial, the court was told about the action taken by police to investigate the matter at the earliest. Among the clinching evidence which solidified the prosecution theory were the accused Irfan’s clothes which were smeared with the survivor’s blood. 
 
 The survivor had also testified before the court and identified the two accused as the men who had committed the act with her. At the crime spot, the two accused’s hair was found by the police, which was sent for DNA and forensic examination. Medical evidence also helped the prosecution in proving the crime and CCTV footage helped in pointing out the men.

 The division bench of acting Chief Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice   Tiwari tasked the principal secretary (Home) to the state of Uttarakhand to constitute SITs in all districts of Uttarakhand within 48 hours.
 
 The court added that each SIT should have a senior superintendent of police or superintendent of police, an additional superintendent of police/circle officer/inspector, inspector of police (woman) and a psychologist/counsellor and a woman social worker. 
 
 The court also directed trial courts to fast track matters of rape while adding that it had already directed the state government to consider amendment in the law for imposing death penalty upon persons convicted of rape of minors. “The state government, till date, has not made its stand clear in the matter,” said the court. Notably, CM Trivendra Singh had earlier said that the state would bring a law to hang child rapists. The court also directed the state government to provide protection to rape victims and close family members.

"Unnao rape and murder case: Key witness dies, buried before autopsy",2018-08-22T20:28:37+05:30,"KANPUR: In a new twist to the   - in which a BJP MLA is an accused - the survivor's family has demanded that the body of a key witness, who died last week, should be exhumed for an autopsy to know the reason for his death. Yunus, who died on August 18, was a witness in the accompanying assault case in which the rape survivor's father was assaulted and succumbed to his injuries in custody of local Maki police station on April 9, 2018.

 
 The matter came to light on Wednesday when the survivor's uncle alleged that Yunus might have been poisoned and demanded an autopsy after exhuming his body. While Maki police station SHO told TOI that Yunus died due to illness, the survivor's uncle sought his family's permission to get the post mortem done.
 
 He said that Yunus was a key witness in the murder of his elder brother whose daughter was allegedly raped by BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar. ""I met Unnao SP Harish Kumar and submitted my application with him. I requested him to exhume the body and get the post mortem done since he was the main witness in the assault case and it is beyond understanding how did he die all of a sudden,"" he said.
 
 Yunus's neighbours in Maki told TOI that he would run a small grocery shop and fell ill on August 18. ""He was being rushed to district hospital, but he passed away on the way. His family members buried him soon after on the same day without informing the police,"" they say.
 
 ""How did Yunus die all of a sudden? He was absolutely well a day before his death on August 18. Also he was buried hurriedly. Why this haste?"" he asks. In his application to SP Unnao, he has stated that BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his men want to get witnesses eliminated and weaken the entire case. ""I, therefore, urge you to register an FIR and instruct the Makhi police station to initiate legal action,"" his application says.
 
 While the CBI is probing the case, Sengar is in jail for allegedly raping the minor girl in June last year and then conspiring to assault her father - which led to his death in police custody - in April this year. Sengar's brother and his aides are also in jail in the assault case.

Minor rape survivor undergoes abortion,2018-08-18T08:16:21+05:30,"TRICHY: Heeding the orders of the   bench of Madras high court, the medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) of a 14-year-old girl was performed on Friday at Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) after careful observation of her precarious health condition. 

 
 
  
 
 Sources said that the abortion was done in the morning after a day of confusion as the doctors waited for the girl’s health condition to turn favourable after her admission to the hospital on Thursday. Passing an order on August 14 on a plea by the girl’s mother for MTP, the court had set August 16 for the procedure as the pregnancy had entered the 20th week after which it would be risky to abort the foetus. It was AWPS Musiri which brought the girl to the hospital in the morning and admitted her for the procedure. The doctors took preliminary tests and fixed the procedure for Friday. 
 
 The girl was the victim of rape by a 56-year-old man at a village near Musiri on the outskirts of  . The crime came to light after she reached her 15th week of pregnancy on June 26 after which the police arrested the man, a driver in Tamil Nadu state transport corporation (TNSTC) at Musiri. Being a neighbour and friend of her father, the man sexually assaulted her when her parents were not at home. 
 
 Initially, the parents of the girl were not for conducting the MTP when the doctors in MGMGH sought their consent. Later, they moved the court seeking a direction considering her under age and the health complications of carrying a baby at a very little age and her future. On August 14, the court gave its permission for the procedure and ordered the dean of MGMGH to carry out MTP on August 16 itself. This was because the dean and head of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology strongly advised terminating the pregnancy before the 20th week that fell on August 23. 
 
 On completion of MTP, the samples were to be taken from the girl and the foetus as well as placenta for DNA test. The samples should be handed over to the inspector of AWPS Musiri which will be sent for the test in forensic laboratory, according to the court order. 
 
 Citing the MTP Act of 1971 which suggests that abortions within 20 weeks of pregnancy need not require legal permission, advocate A Haja Mohideen, who appeared for the girl, said, “If the pregnancy will put the girl’s life at risk, the child welfare officer has the right to decide and arrange for abortion in consultation with the doctors. In this case, they could have found out a solution earlier already instead of making the parent to run from pillar to post,” said Haja adding that the officials were unnecessarily afraid of legal complications due to their ignorance. However, district child protection officer M Geetha and chairperson of the child welfare committee (CWC) said that they had no powers to decide on the MTP.

28-year-old gets 7yrs RI for raping minor girl in 2015,2018-08-12T22:32:00+05:30,"Thane: The Thane sessions court has sentenced a 28-year-old man to seven years   for raping a minor girl in Mumbra in 2015. 

 Judge P P Jadhav, while convicting Shabbir Mulani, said that the victim was a minor and her consent is not a consent in the eyes of the law; hence the accused deserves to be punished.
 
 Mulani was convicted under Sections 376 and 312 of the IPC and Section 4 of the Prevention Of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). He was also fined Rs 30,000.
 
 The accused worked as a contractor and used to make cosmetic jewellery. He used to give jobs to women in the locality. Prosecutor Vivek G Kadu told the court that the victim who was residing in the neighbourhood visited the shop of the accused to collect material.
 
 On May 20, 2015, Mulani called the victim, who was then 17-years-old, to the shop to pack some jewellery. When they were alone in the shop, Mulani raped her, the prosecution alleged.
 
 He further said that two months later, the victim was admitted to a hospital, following an illness. At that time it was detected that she was two months pregnant.
 
  The accused then gave her pregnancy termination pills and forced her to consume it. Till that time, the victim had not disclosed about her sexual assault to her parents as the accused had threatened her. But later she lodged a complaint with the Mumbra police station.
 
 However, the defence rubbished all allegation and denied that he had done anything wrong with the victim.
 
 After hearing both sides, the judge, in his order, said, “In the present case, the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the victim was a minor. The victim being a minor, her consent is not a consent in the eyes of the law. It is pertinent to note here that the accused is a married man and has children.”
 
 The judge added, “Despite this, he lured the victim into having a sexual relation with him. He forced himself upon her and committed sexual intercourse. He has even gone to the extent of causing a miscarriage. Under such circumstances the arguments of defence counsel are not acceptable.”

 The man took her to CWC claiming that he had been taking care of the child and felt that she needed to be taken care of by the commission. Police said that he feared that she might have contacted some disease due to which she often fell unconscious.
 
 The incident was reported to police on Tuesday evening when the CWC counsellors took the child for a medical examination and doctors confirmed sexual assault.
 
 It was found that the child’s father, who used to work at a factory in Nihal Vihar, left her with her maternal uncle after her mother’s death. The accused, who used to stay nearby, was a distant relative of her uncle. He used to stay alone as his wife had married someone else a long time ago.
 
 The accused used to take the child to his house on the pretext of teaching her as she didn’t attend school. He would sexually assault her and threaten her with dire consequences if she told anyone about it. The child would return home and confine herself to her room due to which her aunt or uncle never got to know about the sexual assault.
 
 She had even tried to resist from going to the man’s house for the classes, but eventually gave up, perhaps after being threatened. A case under sections of POCSO and 376(AB) of IPC, which pertains to rape of a child under 12 years and attracts stricter punishment, has been registered against the man.

The accused Parshuram, who is a distant relative of the girl, was arrested on Friday on a complaint by her parents.

 Parshuram had allegedly abducted the girl in an auto-rickshaw of an accomplice, Pavinder, near Kala Patthar around 9am on Wednesday. The duo allegedly took her to Parshuram’s rented accommodation and locked her inside.
 
 “They gagged the girl, forced her into the auto and drove her to Khoda. Pavinder left Khoda after they locked her in the room, where Parshuram raped her. Around 5pm, he took the girl to Delhi and dumped her at Seelampur after threatening her with dire consequences if she revealed anything to her family or police. The girl called her father after borrowing a mobile phone from a passerby. She later told her parents about her ordeal,” said a friend of the girl.
 
 An FIR was registered at Khoda police station on Friday on the basis of a complaint lodged by the girl’s father. Police have invoked Sections 363 (kidnapping) and 376 ( ) of the IPC against Parshuram and Pavinder apart from provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012.
 
 “The girl was walking to her workplace when she was allegedly abducted. Parshuram and Pavinder are brothers-in-law,” said Asghar Ali, the local police outpost in-charge.
 
 Police have launched a manhunt for Pavinder, who is absconding. His likely hideouts are being raided on the basis of information provided by Parshuram during questioning. Sources said there was confusion about the exact age of the girl and it was likely she could be less than 17 years old.
 
 “We have asked the girl’s parents to submit documentary evidence pertaining to her date of birth. A medical examination will be conducted upon her, if necessary, to establish her age. The POCSO Act has been invoked as her parents claimed that she is a minor,” said Khoda SHO Dharmendra Kumar.

Ram Ashray was taken into custody on Thursday night after the girl identified him from the red T-shirt he was wearing. Police found that the man had tried to   the girl two days ago too.

 
 The girl’s parents had approached the cops after finding her clothes torn, her undergarments stained with blood and she told them of what had happened. Doctors at a hospital confirmed sexual assault. On Thursday night, the girl accompanied police to the school and identified the electrician as her assailant.
 
 Ram Ashray has been charged with rape and criminal intimidation. Provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act have also been invoked. Madhur Verma, DCP (New Delhi), said on Friday that the accused had admitted to the sexual assault. “He is being questioned to find out whether he had indulged in similar crimes earlier,” said Verma.
 
 In her statement to the cops, the six-year-old said Ram Ashray has been “stalking” her for some days, even lurking near her classroom on some occasions. On Monday afternoon, he tried to pick her up in an empty corridor. While trying to free herself, she tore the buttons off her shirt. When the man heard someone approaching, he left her and fled. The parents noticed the torn shirt, but did not take it amiss.
 
 Two days later, Ram Ashray caught her outside the school toilet, gagged her and carried her to the pump room where he forced himself on her. After assaulting her for half an hour, he threatened to kill her if she told anyone of what had happened. He left her outside the school.
 
 Shockingly, neither the teachers nor the warden searched for her when she went missing from school. It was her 12-year-old sister who eventually located her near a temple in the area. After reaching home in north Delhi, she initially refused to speak, but eventually told her mother about her ordeal.
 
 In custody, Ram Ashray confessed to having harboured an abnormal desire to rape a child for some time. He had noticed his victim was usually the last to leave the school premises and targeted her.
 
 The class teacher and headmistress of the school and an NDMC assistant engineer have been suspended, while a junior engineer lost his job for not properly verifying the electrician’s antecedents before employing him around two months ago.
 
 Parents staged a protest outside the school on Friday. “We demand safety for our children when they are in school,” said Rakesh Kumar.

 The main accused, hostel director  , was produced in court on Friday and remanded in three days’ police custody. No lawyer agreed to appear for him.
 
 A special investigating team — under SP South Rahul Lodha and comprising two additional SPs and two CSPs — has been set up to probe the hostel sexual abuse. “Twenty-one girls have stayed in the private hostel run by Ashwini Sharma over a period of three years. One of the tasks of the SIT is to enquire if any other girl faced similar torture. In the meantime, if any other complaint is received, prompt action will be taken,” Lodha told TOI.
 
 PCC chief   trained his guns on the CM. Posting a picture of Chouhan at an   meet, Kamal Nath tweeted: “Already having taken the lead in rapes in the country, now girls’ hostels are no longer secure. Like the incidents in Bihar’s   and Devariya in  , the incident in Madhya Pradesh has left the state red-faced. A probe should be conducted in every students’ hostel to ensure the safety of girls. But oblivious to the incident, the chief minister is busy dancing.”

 Headed by Central Bureau of Investigation DIG Abhay Kumar, the team flanked by a number of armed commandos reached the residence on Sahu Road in  , where the shelter home and the office of the Hindi daily 'Pratah Kamal' owned by Thakur, the main accused in the sex scandal, are also situated.
 
 After entering the premises, the commandos locked the main gate of the premises from inside, preventing entry of media-persons and a number of other curious onlookers.. 
 
 The CBI team is understood to have inspected the shelter home, after getting its seal opened, and collected documents and other items it found to be of value in the investigation. 
 
 The CBI team is also understood to have interrogated Thakur's son Rahul Anand, in whose name the Hindi daily is registered and who holds the post of its editor. 
 
 CBI sleuths, accompanied by forensic experts, also inspected the courtyard, which was dug up last month by the police, following allegations by inmates that one of the girls was beaten to death by staff members of the shelter home a few years ago and her body was buried at the spot. 
 
 Nothing incriminating was found after the day-long excavation and the eight-feet-deep pit was again filled up. 
 
 However, the CBI appeared to be in for a second look as heavy earth mover machines have been summoned. 
 
 The Bihar government has cancelled the registration of the NGO - Seva Sankalp Evam Vikas Samiti, which ran the shelter home for destitute girls. 
 
 The possibility of sexual exploitation of the girls at the shelter was first highlighted in an audit report by Tata Institute of Social Sciences, submitted to the state social welfare department in April. Medical examination of the girls later confirmed that 34, of the total 42, were sexually abused. 
 
 The FIR in the case was registered on May 31 against 11 people, including Thakur. On July 26, the Bihar government recommended a CBI inquiry in the matter.

 The five-day-old baby is currently under treatment at the private hospital. 
 
 Dhull said according to doctors at the private hospital, the baby was healthy enough and could be shifted to Civil hospital in next two-three days.

And process for adoption will start after three months or so, she added.
 
 Further, Dhull said the committee would present a case before the Haryana State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (HSCPCR) for surrender of the newborn. “After two months, the committee will counsel the 16-year-old and her parents again, giving them a chance to review their decision. If they stick to the decision to surrender, the committee will take an affidavit from them,” she explained.

Bhopal hostel chief arrested for allegedly raping tribal girl,2018-08-11T19:38:40+05:30,"BHOPAL/INDORE: With the country reeling from rapes at shelter homes in Bihar and UP, Bhopal has added to the horror. The director of a government-run hostel for the disabled was arrested on Thursday for allegedly raping a deaf-mute inmate and molesting several others.
 
 
 The survivor, a 19-year-old tribal girl, was suffering in silence until another inmate — who the accused had allegedly molested — ran away and told her parents that teen needed to be rescued. Alarmed, the teenager’s brother rushed to Bhopal and took her out of the hostel. Unsure of what to do next, they approached the deaf-mute help desk at Tukoganj in Indore, where she narrated her ordeal in sign language.
 
 
 
 
 
 A ‘zero FIR’ was filed at Kotwali police station in Dhar on Wednesday and the case diary was transferred to Bhopal Police after which the accused, 36-year-old Ashwini Sharma, was arrested on Thursday. When the survivor was asked to pick out the accused from a line-up, she couldn’t control her rage and slapped him, say sources.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sharma runs two such hostels in the city, both aided by social welfare department. Both hostels have been emptied and police are interviewing the inmates. All of them will be medically examined, said an officer.
 
 Congress trained its guns on the BJP government, demanding to know why it didn’t run a check before funding Sharma’s NGO. “The Shivraj Singh Chouhan government is observing Adivasi Diwas today, yet two tribal girls were molested and raped in a government-funded hostel. Yesterday, a tribal committed suicide in Betul because she was raped and the incident filmed,” said state Congress media cell chief Shobha Oza. TOI tried to contact government spokesperson Narottam Mishra but couldn’t get through.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Bhopal DIG Dharmendra Choudhary said the survivor was put up at the hostel after she took admission at an ITI in Bhopal in July 2016. She has told police that Sharma started misbehaving with her on Diwali 2017. When she protested, he used to assault her, says her complaint. On December 24, 2017, Sharma allegedly grabbed her and tried to drag her into a room in the hostel, but another inmate (whose escape opened the can of worms) tried to save her. Sharma pushed her aside, forced the teenager into a room and raped her, says the complaint, adding that it was the beginning of her sexual torture. Sharma allegedly raped her several times, and whenever she protested, he would threaten her.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 DIG Choudhary said Sharma forced her to stay back during vacations, claiming that her parents wanted her to remain in Bhopal. He did not allow her to go back even after she completed her ITI diploma. The last time he raped her was on August 4, says the complaint.
 
 DIG Choudhary said that the survivor’s friend went home and told the teen’s family about her ordeal. Her brother came to Bhopal and took her back on August 6. The family members then approached the deaf and mute help Desk at Tukoganj. IG (Bhopal Range) Jaideep Prasad said the survivor has alleged that Sharma sexually exploited other hostel inmates too. She identified the accused in a line-up, he said. Police say Sharma used to visit railway stations or bus-stands to pick up new inmates and those returning from vacation because he didn’t want their families to know the way to the hostel. The inmates were entirely at his mercy, say police.

HC quashes rape charges against Jayanti Bhanushali,2018-08-08T04:54:00+05:30,"Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Tuesday quashed the rape complaint against BJP leader   after the 21-year-old woman complainant reiterated that the dispute between her and the former MLA was amicably settled.

 Justice P P Bhatt allowed Bhanushali’s quashing petition after the investigator independently verified with the complainant that she had not entered the compromise under influence or pressure.
 
 The state government continued to oppose the quashing petition on the grounds that an FIR pertaining to an offence like rape cannot be quashed merely on basis of a compromise between the accused and the victim, because this is not a compoundable offence.
 
 Bhanushali’s advocate, P B Khandheriya, said the quashing petition was filed on merit, but looking at subsequent developments, it was amended accordingly on Tuesday.
 
 Bhanushali claimed in his petition that the complainant from Surat is part of an extortion racket run by Manisha Goswami of Kutch. His advocate submitted in court that Bhanushali was the victim of a honey-trap.

"Two get death for raping, murdering girl in Jodhpur",2018-08-08T12:29:20+05:30,"JODHPUR: Barely a few hours after an acrimonious comment by the Supreme Court on Tuesday about rampant rapes in the country, a   court in Jodhpur, handed death sentence to two accused of raping and murdering a minor girl, in 2013.

 
 A special court for POCSO cases here in Jodhpur, sentenced two persons, Ghewar Singh and Sharavan Singh, to death on Tuesday, while holding them convicted for rape and murder of a minor girl with a view to erase the evidence.
 
 In the order, special Judge Vamita Singh said, that the act of both the accused is dastardly and is against humanity, heinous at its utmost limit and gruesome; hence it comes under the category of rarest of the rare crimes. “For this, it is bounden to punish Ghewar Singh and Sharavan Singh only with death sentence for justice to prevail,” the order said.
 
 A police team led by the then SP (Barmer) Rahul Barhat, had arrested Ghewar Singh and Sharavan Singh along with three others, for abducting a minor girl from her house in village Rinva in Barmer’s   at night and raping her on March 29-30, 2013.
 
 “After raping the girl, the accused had killed her by throwing her from hilly rocks with a view to erase the evidences,” said the prosecution counsel Karnaram Choudhary.
 
 After recovering her body from between the rocks on March 31, police had registered a case under various sections of IPC for abduction,   and murder, SC/ST Act and POCSO Act.
 
 Pronouncing the judgement after five years of the case, the special court here ordered both Ghewar Singh and Sharavan Singh to be hanged till death under Section 376 A, and sentenced the three co-accused namely Prahlad Singh, Narsing Singh and Shanker Singh to seven years of rigorous imprisonment each, for hiding the crime.
 
 Though, the defence counsel pleaded lenience considering the accused being fathers of small children and having no criminal antecedent, but turning down the arguments, the court stated, “Where a minor girl was abducted and gang-raped without any provocation and brutally murdered, and the murder was so gruesome that it stirred not only the conscience of the society but judicial conscience also, death sentence would be the only justice”.

Muzaffarpur rape survivors want to lead simple life: Counsellor,2018-08-08T08:59:43+05:30,"PATNA: They were scarred, beaten up, drugged and raped by strangers repeatedly over a period of four years, but they want to lead a simple life and be accepted by all, said a counsellor working with the girls rescued from the   shelter home.

 “They are emotionally very vulnerable. They take time to open up,” said the counsellor at a Patna shelter home where 13 of the girls have been kept.
 
 An employee there told this newspaper the girls wake up at 6.30am and go to bed by 9.30pm. After the breakfast, they practise writing and learn words.
 
 “They are now friendly with the other girls at the centre and play and dance together. We also conduct motivation classes for them after lunch. They watch television from 8pm for 45 minutes after dinner. Most of the time, we let them play,” the counsellor said.
 
 “Boosting their confidence in such a short span of time is quite challenging. It’s only two months since they have been shifted here,” she added.
 
 The girls were shifted to two shelter homes in Patna, one at Mokama and another in Madhubani on May 30 following the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) report on the sexual, mental and physical harassment of girls at the state government-funded Muzaffarpur children home run by NGO Seva Sankalp Evam Vikas Samiti. The girls were brought to Muzaffarpur shelter under different circumstances between 2013 and 2017. NGO owner Brajesh Thakur is among the ten persons arrested in the case.
 
 An employee of a Patna shelter home where the girls have been kept for rehabilitation said, “The girls have been given freedom to do anything they like. We keep them busy in several activities. The girls attend informal classes in subjects like English,   and   up to standard IV. The teachers are trying to teach them.”
 
 Social welfare department director Raj Kumar told this newspaper on Monday that the department, along with the United Nations Children’s Fund, is likely to hold a trauma management programme for the rescued girls.
 
 “Enfold and Parivartan, the two organisations from Hyderabad, have been roped in for the   treatment to the rescued girls and a five-day long session will be organised at Mokama shelter home from August 10 to help them get over the trauma related to their ordeal,” he said.
 
 “When the girls were shifted to other centres, they were angry and hurt and used to become aggressive on hearing the word Muzaffarpur. But things are improving as the counsellors individually counsel them and take their views. However, we avoid mentioning about the ordeal they had gone through. Counselling underaged victims is tough because they find it difficult to express their trauma,” Kumar said.

The incident the woman alleged had taken place nearly a year before she approached police. Pambhar was booked under Section 376C of IPC because he was in a position of authority or in a fiduciary relationship. Pambhar also faced charges under the Atrocities Act because the complainant belonged to the SC community.
 
 Pambhar approached Rajkot district sessions court in August last year for pre-arrest bail and contended that he was innocent, the FIR was fabricated, and the complaint was filed at a belated stage. The court granted him anticipatory bail on certain conditions on September 13, 2017.

However, she continued to stay at her parents’ house and her ‘rukhsati’ (shifting to in-laws’ house) was held in September 2015. “On the day of my rukshati ceremony, my in-laws demanded a car and refused to take me home if their demand was fulfilled. I could go to my in-laws’ house only after the intervention of elders who convinced them. On December 24, 2015, my in-laws left me outside my parents’ house and told me to return only with the car. Three days later, my husband gave me instant triple talaq over the phone. After I lodged an FIR against them for domestic violence and dowry, we entered into a compromise on December 24, 2016 after the intervention of police,” the woman said. After a written settlement took place between the woman and her husband, she was informed that she will have to undergo nikah halala as she was given divorce. “There has been pressure on me for halala which I hated.

 “We had called Manju Verma and she denied her role in the case. CBI is probing the case. If someone related to the minister is found involved in the case, he/she will not be spared. Even the minister, if found involved, will not be spared,” Nitish told reporters after his weekly ‘Lok Samvad’ programme. “Let the investigating agency do its job. Is it justified to level baseless allegations against any person?” Nitish asked.
 
 Nitish also said from now the state government would itself run all shelter homes. Admitting that the Muzaffarpur incident happened due to “flaw in the system”, Nitish declared henceforth no NGO would be allowed to run any shelter home in Bihar.
 
 “During the review, it was found that the wrongdoings were committed by the NGO. There are some flaws in the system. We have asked the officers to check those flaws. Now, only government employees will be involved in running shelter homes for having a better control,” Nitish added.

  Speaking at the 'Mahila Adhikar Sammelan' in Delhi, Rahul said “PM Modi who is otherwise extremely vocal about multiple things and is hard to keep shut, doesn't utter a single word when women are attacked and raped in our country.”
 
  Citing incidents of crimes against women in the BJP ruled states, Rahul accused Modi of going soft against rape accused from his party.
 
  “In UP and other BJP ruled states, when crimes are committed against women, PM Modi stays silent. No action is taken against the accused if he is a member of their party,” he said.
 
  
  
  Taunting the Modi government over their ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ slogan, Rahul said it was the BJP ministers that posed danger for girls.
 
  “They said 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao'. I cannot understand from whom. Is it the BJP MLAs that daughters need to be saved from?” he asked mockingly.
 
  
  
  Continuing his tirade against PM Modi, Rahul claimed that the 4-year rule of the BJP government since 2014 was far worse than Congress rule or women in the country.

If they table the bill, we will give them full support but if they don't, then as soon as Congress party comes to the power after next year’s general elections, we will pass the bill,” he said.
 
  
  
 Rahul ended his address by expressing happiness over opposition parties uniting with the Congress to defeat the BJP.
 
  
  
  “The democratic institutions of the country are under attack by the BJP. It is the duty of the Congress party and opposition, particularly women in the parties, to defend these institutions,” he said.

As per National Crime Records Bureau data, 38,947 cases of rape were reported in 2016, which means every day four women are raped.”

 
 Putting the state government in the dock for its failure to rein in such NGOs, a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur, Deepak Gupta and K M Joseph said the state government was aware of the goings-on but no action was taken against the Muzaffarpur-based NGO while its owner and main accused in the case remained in the good books of the government and continued to get funds.

She said the report had so far not been made public but the issue was flagged. 
 
 “Why has the report not been made public? Is it an official secret? It means that some of the officers of the state government had knowledge about it but action was not taken... Have you taken action against the 15 NGOs?” the bench asked senior advocate Ranjit Kumar who was appearing for the state government. Kumar said the   had ordered a CBI probe into the Muzaffarpur incident and all accused, except one who is absconding, had been arrested. 
 
 He said action had been taken against six of the 15 NGOs about which concerns were raised during the social audit. He said action had also been taken against government officials and some of them had been suspended. The court, however, wondered how the state government could fund NGOs without examining their credentials. 
 
 “People are paying taxes and you are giving people’s money to these institutions. It is not a private organisation but funded by the government and it means that the state financed these activities,” it said. The court directed the government to place the audit reports and also frame a comprehensive plan on counselling and rehabilitation of the rape survivors. 
 
 It ordered that even morphed pictures and videos of minor rape survivors would not be published or broadcast on any media platform, including on social media.

 Police have, however, charged Deepak with rape and under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act.
 
 The girl’s father said Deepak had been staying on rent for the past one year with his wife and one-year-old son. “My daughter would go to his room to play with his son. We never thought he would do such a thing,” the father said. He demanded capital punishment for Deepak.
 
 On August 2, when the girl had gone to Deepak’s room, his wife and son had left for his in-laws’ place in Mainpuri. The next day, the cabbie left his room without informing anybody, which aroused suspicion among the girl’s relatives that he could be involved in her disappearance. After the body was found on August 4, an FIR was registered against Deepak, who remained untraceable.
 
 Sources said some of Deepak’s friends in Khoda had informed the cabbie that he had been named in an FIR and the police were looking for him. He fled to Bulandshahr, where he had worked earlier, but did not go to his in-laws’ place in Mainpuri though it was his son’s birthday on August 5. Deepak was arrested around 5am on Tuesday from Khoda area, based on a tip-off.
 
 The girl’s relatives beat him up in the presence of SSP Vaibhav Krishna when he was brought to the Police Lines for a news conference on Tuesday afternoon. Krishna said he would urge the court to fast track the case and appeal for maximum punishment. The officer also ordered an internal inquiry into the family’s allegation that the police had delayed in getting an autopsy done.
 
 Deepak’s neighbours in Khoda said he would often come home drunk and fight with his wife. “He was an alcoholic and would drink every day, but he kept to himself. We never saw him fighting with any outsider or creating a ruckus in the neighbourhood. He was with us when we searched for the girl. We began suspecting his role when he left his room without informing anybody,” said a neighbour.

Third-party audit of shelter homes begins in Rajasthan,2018-08-09T07:59:54+05:30,"JAIPUR: In the wake of the recent Muzaffarpur   rape incident,   has issued directions of third party inspections of all child shelter homes across the state. There are at least 150 care homes run by the government and NGOs. 

 However, the directorate of child rights (DCR) claimed that no case of sexual abuse has come to light in the recent past, but they have taken action against a care home running without registration.
 
 More than 4,000 children are residing in 40 government-run and 104 homes run by NGOs and other organisations. “It will be a detailed social audit which will be done by third party. We have started it recently and in at least two child care homes, we have completed it. We have started it with the help of National Commission of Protection of Child Rights, even before the Muzaffarpur incident was reported,” said Shruti Bhardwaj, assistant director, directorate of child rights. 
 
 The third party social audit will also record statements of children staying in care homes, to find out if they have faced any crime against them, while inspecting the conditions in which the children are residing in care homes across the state. 
 
 No sexual abuse cases have been reported from care homes in the state in the recent past. But, one care home in Kota has been seized, which was functioning without any registration. 
 
 Moreover, she said that surveillance of child care homes — government and private as well — will be increased. “We have installed CCTV cameras in care homes but we will increase its numbers. Measures will be taken so that we can watch activities in all the care homes from one place,” she said. 
 
 DCR expressed confidence on the system in place for preventing any sexual abuse of children in child care homes. “We have district child protection unit (DCPU) headed by district collector in each district. The member secretary of DCPU is our assistant director, who conducts frequent visits to care homes, at least twice in a month. We have a multi-functionary system, which includes child welfare committees at districts, which takes care of all issues ranging from education to rehabilitation of children. To support CWCs, we have a counsellor, which provides counselling to children whenever they feel down and require psychological help. Also, we have branches of Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority in districts. Moreover, there are juvenile justice boards,” she said, adding that the multi-functionary system, helps to ensure that child rights remain intact.

 “Bihar’s mandate is till November 2020. Opposition parties should have patience and wait till that period. Why should Nitish Kumar resign midway?” JD(U) national general secretary and spokesperson K C Tyagi asked.
 
 He also challenged the state’s opposition parties to unseat Nitish Kumar, if they have enough strength in the 243-member Bihar assembly.
 
 The JD(U) spokesperson further criticised the opposition leaders including Congress president   for attending the RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav-led dharna and candle protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi on Saturday.
 
 “Their assembly at the Jantar Mantar was not meant for welfare of the victim minor girls. Their actual agenda was 2019 general election. How can rape of minor girls which has shamed all of us could be an issue to unite against the NDA government and the Nitish Kumar-led government in Bihar? Their politics over the minor victims is the most unfortunate thing, which needs to be criticised,” Tyagi told TOI over the phone from New Delhi.
 
 He said Nitish Kumar recommended a CBI probe into the shelter home case on the opposition’s demand. “He (Nitish) is a sensitive person. He openly admitted that he felt ashamed over the incident which the opposition parties are trying to use to hit at his conscience so that he relinquishes the post. But, the JD(U) will not let him do so,” Tyagi said.
 
 The JD(U) leader also alleged that the resignation demand was aimed at “assisting” the powerful sand and liquor lobby that have been effectively marginalised by the Nitish government.
 
 Tyagi further slammed Rahul Gandhi, saying his joining the Tejashwi-led protest was “very unfortunate”. He also condemned CPM leader   and CPI’s D Raja, saying how could the two leaders forgot the killings of JNU president Chandra Shekhar and Purnia MLA Ajit Sarkar and joined the protest organised by RJD.

 Speaking at the launch of Mukhyamantri Kanya Utthan Yojana, a scheme for girls, Nitish said, “We all are ‘sharmashar’ (ashamed) over the incident.”
 
 Nitish assured the state that everyone found guilty in this case would be severely punished. “I will ensure that no guilty person is spared,” he said.
 
 The CM said deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi had already announced in the assembly that the government would like the   high court to monitor the CBI probe into the Muzaffarpur case. “I have also asked the advocate   to make a request for monitoring of the case by the high court so that no guilty person gets a chance to go unpunished,” he said.
 
 Terming the shelter home incident as “an act of sin”, the CM said he has asked the chief secretary, DGP and other senior official to find out any serious flaw in the existing system. “How such people (like Brajesh Thakur) succeeded in entering the system? I am deeply pained and it is very disgusting,” Nitish said. 
 
 He asked chief secretary Deepak Kumar (on the dais) to develop an institutional mechanism to prevent recurrence of such shameful incident. CM also asked the officers to develop a transparent mechanism, which could enable common people to inform officers if they have any information about such misdeeds.

Nitish not to quit over shelter home rapes: JD(U),2018-08-06T08:01:30+05:30,"PATNA: Rejecting the opposition’s demand, JD(U) on Sunday said CM   would not resign over the Muzaffarpur shelter home rapes and the party was ready for the Supreme Court or Patna high court monitoring of the probe into the case.

 “Bihar’s mandate is till November 2020. Opposition should have patience. Why should   resign midway?” JD(U) national general secretary and spokesperson K C Tyagi said and challenged the state’s opposition parties to unseat Nitish if they have enough strength in the 243-member legislative assembly. Nitish is also the JD(U) national president.
 
 Tyagi criticised the opposition leaders, including Congress president Rahul Gandhi, for attending the RJD-led dharna and candle march at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on Saturday. “Their assembly was not meant for the welfare of the victim girls. Their actual agenda was 2019 general elections. How can the rape of minor girls, which has shamed all of us, could be an issue to unite against the NDA government at the Centre and Nitish-led government in  ? Their politics over the issue is the most unfortunate thing,” Tyagi told TOI over the phone from Delhi.
 
 He said Nitish recommended for a CBI probe into the shelter home case on the opposition’s demand. “He (Nitish) is a sensitive person. The CM openly admitted that he felt ashamed over the incident. But the opposition parties are trying to hit his conscience so that he relinquishes the post. But, JD(U) will not let him do so,” Tyagi said.
 
 Tyagi also alleged that the resignation demand was aimed at “assisting” the powerful sand and liquor lobbies that have been effectively marginalized by the Nitish government. He further slammed Rahul Gandhi, saying his joining the protest led by RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav was “very unfortunate”. He also condemned CPM leader Sitaram Yechury and CPI’s D Raja for joining the protest, saying how could they forget the killings of JNU president   and Purnia MLA Ajit Sarkar.

Cops probing role of foster mother too in rape case,2018-08-05T07:41:00+05:30,"Ludhiana: A day after the arrest of the foster father of a 11-year-old girl, police on Saturday arrested her adoptive mother too in connection with her rape. Both were produced before a local court, and sent to police remand for one day.

 Police had registered a case, following a complaint that the girl’s adoptive father and grandfather had been repeatedly raping the girl for the past about one year. It was also alleged that the girl’s foster mother had forced her into prostitution. Cops investigating the case said no proper procedure was followed for adoption, and all that the police could recover in the name of adoption documents was an affidavit.
 
 “The accused couple had adopted the girl through the panchayat with the help of a Phagwara-based man, Pammi. The couple only has an affidavit through which they adopted the girl, which — as per the procedure — is not sufficient. The legal adoption of a child by his relatives and outsiders requires an online process and other legal formalities,” said a senior police official.
 
 Investigating officer inspector Varinder Pal Singh said the police was in the process of identifying the men who visited her house after being called by her foster mother, and developed physical relations with her. “The police will nominate them in the case and proceed according to law,” he said.
 
 On Friday, an 11-year-old class VI student of a government school accused her foster father and foster grandfather for raping her for about one year. She also accused her foster mother of forcing her into prostitution. The school principal complained to a police officer, after which an FIR was lodged. Claiming that the process adopted for adoption was not legal, Singh said the police was also probing the role of the girl’s mother. 
 
 District child protection officer Rashmi said further details were being sought into the matter for a detailed inquiry. Sharing details on the process of legal adoption, Rashmi said: “If the child is being adopted by extended relatives like maternal or paternal grandparents, then there are two procedures — one, through Hindu Adoption Maintenance Act (Hama), in which the tehsildar is involved for adoption; and two, through an online process of the Central Adoption Resource Authority (Cara) under the Juvenile Justice Act. Under Cara, the couple willing to adopt a child has to apply online, with the process taking about eight months to complete. If the child is being adopted by an outsider, then it can be done through government agencies, and again it’s an online process,” she added.
 
 When questioned if an affidavit was enough for legal adoption, she replied categorically: “If a child is adopted through just an affidavit, then it would be called an illegal adoption.”

They started teasing them from a distance and later caught hold of the fiancé of the woman and thrashed him until he fell unconscious. The accused then tied him with a rope and gang raped the 17-year-old girl, leaving her seriously injured. The couple was unconscious when shifted to a hospital by local people. 
 
 The traumatized couple could not gather courage to contact police on regaining consciousness in the hospital, but an alert doctor brought the incident to their notice. The couple refused to register the complaint when police approached them, forcing the cops to become complainant in the case themselves.

 Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong for the 25-year-old in the year he attained a career-high 58th in the International Table Tennis Federation rankings.
 
 In March, he was accused for rape by an 18-year-old that led to the two-time Olympian and India's youngest ever national champion hitting ""rock bottom"".
 
 Four months on, he has not even felt the racquet in his hand, is heavier by more than 10 kgs and is a married man.
 
 ""They say a sportsperson in India has to go through a lot to achieve something. The grind prepares you for the worst but what happened with me four months ago hit me hard and hit me out of nowhere. I did not know how to deal with it,"" Ghosh said.
 
 ""Everyone thought about the girl. That she was young. I was young too. If she was a minor, I was 22 when we started dating. I am still young. Having said that, there is no point looking back. I rather look ahead. Hope my court case is over soon and I get back to training,"" said the skilful player, who will be ""dearly missed"" at the upcoming   in Indonesia.
 
 Ghosh was playing in Germany in March when he heard about the FIR filed against him by the teenager in Barasat, West Bengal. Fearing arrest on arrival in India, he chose to stay back in Europe and stayed in ""three-four different countries"" before returning home in May.
 
 ""It was only during that time, I found out who were actually my well-wishers. I was devastated. I was at the peak of my career, playing for a good club in Germany and then something like this happens.
 
 ""I would not name them yet but I survived that phase because of just two people and my parents of course,"" he said.
 
 In fact his teammates - the veteran  ,  ,   - also stood by him. If it was not for the rape allegations, Ghosh would have gone with the team to the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, where the contingent came up with a best-ever performance.
 
 ""TTFI, the players were all there for me. All was going wrong but their support kept me going. After CWG, the team went to World Championship straight and lost a close match to Croatia. Sharath bhai called me and told me 'we would have won today if you were around'. It made me feel that I was still needed.""
 
 In the big year for Indian sport, he will end up missing the Asian Games as well.

Parliament passes bill to provide death to child rape convicts,2018-08-06T20:50:12+05:30,"NEW DELHI: Parliament today passed a stringent legislation prescribing death penalty to those convicted of raping girls below the age of 12 years and making the law against such sexual offences harsher.

 
 The Bill replaces the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance promulgated on April 21, following an outcry over the rape and murder of a minor girl in Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir and the rape of another woman at Unnao in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 The Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2018, which was passed in the Lok Sabha on July 30, was approved by a voice vote in the Upper House.
 
 While replying to a debate in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju assured the House that the concerns and issues raised by the members would be looked into by the government, even as he did not agree with the demand of several MPs to send the bill to a Select Committee for scrutiny.
 
 Terming the bill as one of national importance, Rijiju said the law is aimed at providing safety to minor girls as he highlighted various aspects of the measure.
 
 He said the government brought the bill, as in the last few months, several heart-rending incidents of rape of under- aged girls have taken place in the country.
 
 Rijiju said four states had already brought a law in their respective assemblies for capital punishement those who commit rape gainst the girl child who are under the age of 12. The states are Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh.
 
 ""We have introduced certain changes in the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Court Procedure, Evidence Act and there are consequential effects on prevention of atrocities against children,"" the minister said.
 
 The bill stipulates stringent punishment for perpetrators of rape, particularly of girls below 12 years. Death sentence has been provided for rapists of girls under 12 years.
 
 The minimum punishment in cases of rape of women has been increased from rigorous imprisonment of seven years to 10 years.
 
 According to the bill, in case of rape of a girl under 16 years, the minimum punishment has been increased from 10 to 20 years, extendable to imprisonment for rest of life, which means jail term till the convict's ""natural life"".
 
 Stringent   of a girl under 12 years has been provided with the minimum jail term being 20 years which may go up to life in prison or death sentence. Gangrape of a girl under 12 years of age will invite punishment of jail term for the rest of life or death.
 
 The measure also provides for speedy investigations and trial. The time limit for investigation of all cases of rape has been prescribed, which has to be mandatorily completed within two months.
 
 The deadline for the completion of trial in all rape cases will be two months. A six-month time limit for the disposal of appeals in rape cases has also been prescribed, the bill says, adding that there will also be no provision for anticipatory bail for a person accused of rape or gangrape of a girl under 16 years.
 
 Participating in the debate, several members made a case for sending the bill for scrutiny to Select Committee, saying there were several shortcomings in it.
 
 Some members argued that the provision of death penalty could affect reporting of cases of sexual assault as in many cases the accused happened to be relatives or known persons.
 
 There was also an opinion that the provision of death penalty could endanger the life of the victim.
 
 Many members suggested that the government change the term 'woman' in the bill appropriately and make it gender- neutral as such crimes do happen with boys as well.
 
 Sukhendu Sekhar Ray (TMC) wondered why there are different punishment according to the age of the vicitm. He also expressed concern over the large pendency of cases in courts in the country.
 
 Manoj Kumar Jha (RJD) expressed concern that provision of death penalty may endanger victim's life, while Kahkashan Perween JD(U) suggested that like in Bihar, there should be women police stations in all states.
 
 Chhaya Verma (Cong) said punishment should be the same for those convicted for rape, irrespective of the gender of child victim.
 
 Ravi Prakash Verma (SP) said the bill should be sent to a select commitee as it took care only of girls and not boys. Citing a survey, he added that the cases of sexual violence were more against boys.
 
 Rajeev Gowda (Congress) also aked the government refer it to a select committee.

Media must not publish/broadcast even morphed images of minor rape victim: SC,2018-08-03T04:40:11+05:30,"NEW DELHI: The SC has said there should be a complete ban on publication and telecast of even morphed images of minor rape survivors to protect their privacy even as it restrained media from broadcasting images and interview of the minor girls who were allegedly raped in a shelter home in  .

 Taking suo motu cognisance of the alleged rape and sexual abuse of 30 minor girls by the chief of a state-funded NGO which was running the shelter home in Muzaffarpur, a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta sought explanation from the Bihar government and expressed anguish over the media conductive “insensitive” interviews with them in utter violation of norms. It was brought to the court’s notice by a Patna-based activist, Ranvijay Kumar.
 
 The bench said the media has been virtually forcing the rape survivors to “relive the trauma again and again” and this must be stopped. It said government agencies should also be restrained from directly interacting with the girls.
 
 Referring to the restraint observed by the media in   during the rescue of 12 boys and their coach from a flooded cave, the bench said no one came to know about their identities till the operation was over. 
 
 “It is disgusting... Any interaction with the victims by investigating agency or any other government agency including child rights bodies must be done by professional counsellors or child psychologists,” the bench said.
 
 Additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta and advocate Aparna Bhat, who was appointed amicus curiae to assist the court, echoed the court’s sentiment and pleaded it to step in to protect the interests of the minor victims.
 
 “In the name of freedom of expression, we cannot expose our children who are already under trauma. Why should they be interviewed at all by the media. Media should also be barred from interviewing parents of the victims as it also exposes the identity. Children have right to anonymity and it must be respected by all,” the ASG said.

When the girl didn’t respond to the text messages and phone calls, he started riding around her house and school on a motorcycle.
 
 Later, he started writing letters in filthy language where he also mentioned that he was following her. He also threatened to sexually assault her. Police said he would bundle up the letters and throw them in the girl’s house and speed off on the motorcycle. This continued for about 25 days.
 
 Initially, the family members were clueless about who was throwing the letters. To catch hold of the culprit, they noted the timings when the letters would be thrown. One day, the girl’s younger sister sat in the balcony and made a video recording of the accused coming on the motorcycle and throwing a letter. The girl showed the video to her mother following which the family decided to contact the police.

 A division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Zaka Haq directed the respondents including union health secretary and state public health services’ principal secretary, to seek her husband’s opinion on whether he too wanted to terminate the pregnancy. District   Hospital through its medical officer and Amravati Central Prison superintendent were other respondents in the case. While issuing notices to respondents, HC asked them to reply by August 8. 
 
 According to Bhatia, who took pains to draft the petition after she was assigned to the petitioner through legal aid, said the 26-year-old survivor and her husband were convicted by the   Sessions Court on May 17 under Section 324 and 302 of IPC. They already have one seven-year-old daughter and a four-year-old son, who was allowed to stay with the mother.
 
 When the trial was underway, she was out on bail and her husband was behind the bars. The incident took place on May 16, just before a day she was convicted. During midnight, her cousin brother-in-law allegedly visited her home and forced himself on her. After finishing the heinous act, he threatened the petitioner of dire consequences.

However, after a month or so, she realized that her monthly menstrual cycle was stopped and she complained about it to the medical officer in the jail. When she was diagnosed on July 6, it came to fore that she was one and half months pregnant.
 
 Subsequently, she narrated the whole incident to husband and then lodged a police complaint with the help of jail authorities in Akola.

She cited ‘Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971’ stating that its provisions also apply to rape survivors. “She is already a convict and now a rape victim, due to which she is already suffering from the trauma. Moreover, she is also facing financial hardships. Hence, she wouldn’t be able to take care of the third child,” the lawyer told the HC.

SC restrains media from showing images of Bihar shelter home rape victims,2018-08-02T18:39:03+05:30,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday restrained the electronic media from showing, even in morphed form, images of the alleged victims of rape and sexual assault at a shelter home in Bihar's Muzaffarpur district, observing they cannot be compelled to ""relive the trauma"" again and again.

 
 The apex court ban in which the media was also asked not to interview the victims came on a day when a state-wide bandh was called by the Left parties in Bihar to protest against the alleged sex abuse at the shelter home run by a state-funded NGO.
 
 A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta took cognisance of the Bihar incident and said it was a cause for serious concern that alleged victims of sexual violence were interviewed a number of times and were made to repeat the incident.
 
 ""Is this the way we are treating our girls?,"" the bench said and asked the media not to interview the alleged victims of sexual abuse at the shelter home while restraining them from telecasting or publishing the images of the victims even in morphed form.
 
 ""Now the probe has been handed over to the CBI. Will these girls be questioned in front of a camera? It is not easy for anybody. They have to relive the trauma. It is horrible,"" the bench observed and issued notices to the Centre and Bihar government seeking their responses on the incident.
 
 ""How you talk to a child is different from how you talk to an adult. I had yesterday seen a clip. You do not talk to an alleged victim of rape like this. There are different ways of talking,"" Justice Lokur said and questioned as to why these alleged victims should ever be interviewed like this.
 
 Advocate Aparna Bhat, who was appointed as an amicus curiae in the matter, requested the court to give a direction that there should not be any media interview of the alleged victims.
 
 ""What about freedom of speech and expression? Media will then say that the Supreme Court is banning them,"" the bench said.
 
 It referred to the recent incident in Thailand where several children, who were part of a football team, along with their coach were trapped inside a cave for several days during a group outing.
 
 ""They were not allowed to be interviewed for 15-20 days (after they came out of the cave). They only had a joint interview of all of them,"" the bench said.
 
 The top court said it was ""extremely disturbed"" after going through the letter received from Patna-resident Ranvijay Kumar who has raised the issue of repeated interviews of the alleged victims of the Muzaffarpur incident.
 
 The bench said it has not restrained the police authority from conducting probe and if they want to question the alleged victims, they would have to take assistance of professional counsellors and qualified child psychiatrist in consultation with National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences in Bengaluru and Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) in Mumbai.
 
 The bench also noted that orders have been delivered by the apex court repeatedly that victims of sexual assaults should not be compelled to relive the trauma of the incident.
 
 ""In this case, there were multiple questioning and interviews and these girls were compelled to relive the trauma again and again. It is not conducive for their (victims) welfare,"" it said and posted the matter for hearing on August 7.
 
 During the hearing, Bhat told the bench there has to be a protocol for interviewing minor victims of such cases.
 
 Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said a minor must be insulated from any kind of such interviews.
 
 The bench also asked whether any compensation has been given to these alleged victims.
 
 While Bhat said that compensation scheme was there in Bihar, the ASG said, ""there may be a compensation scheme but what they (alleged victims) have lost, cannot be quantified"".
 
 Bhat told the court that media reports related to the incident should not be banned but these minor girls cannot be subjected to such kind of interviews.
 
 The ASG said nowadays parents of victims of such cases were being shown on television without even blurring their faces and it leads to disclosure of the victim's identity.
 
 At the fag end of the hearing, the amicus said notices should also be issued to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Press Council of India in the matter.
 
 ""They will do nothing,"" the bench said, adding, ""electronic media is not under control of the press council. Nobody is under any control"".
 
 Over 30 girls were allegedly raped at the shelter home run by one Brajesh Thakur, the chief of the state-funded NGO.
 
 The alleged sexual exploitation of the girls was first highlighted in an audit report submitted by the TISS to the state's social welfare department in April.
 
 An FIR was lodged against 11 people, including Thakur on May 31. The probe has now been taken over by the CBI.
 
 In all, sexual abuse of 34 inmates out of 42 was confirmed in their medical examination, while two others who were unwell were yet to undergo medical tests.
 
 The TISS audit report stated that many girls at the shelter home had complained of sexual abuse. A special investigation team was formed to probe the complaints.
 
 The NGO running the shelter home in Muzaffarpur was blacklisted and the girls were shifted to shelter homes in Patna and Madhubani.
 
 Women staff members of the shelter home and Thakur were among those who were arrested by the local police in connection with the case.

Lok Sabha passes bill for death to child rape convicts,2018-07-30T20:09:49+05:30,"NEW DELHI: A crucial bill seeking to provide death penalty to those convicted of raping girls below the age of 12 years was passed by the Lok Sabha on Monday.

 
 The bill seeks to replace the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance promulgated on April 21, following an outcry over the rape and murder of a minor girl in Kathua in   and the rape of another woman at Unnao in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 Although the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2018 was supported by most members across the political spectrum and passed by a voice vote, some in the Opposition objected to the government adopting the ordinance route to enact the law.
 
 Several amendments moved by the opposition members were also negated by voice vote.
 
 Replying to an over two hour discussion on the measure, Minister of State for Home   said the stringent law was aimed at providing safety to minor girls.
 
 He said the existing   provided for punishment to those convicted of raping a woman, but there was no provision for rape or gangrape of minor girls below 16 or 12 years of age. These are ""very important provisions"" which the government has proposed, Rijiju said.
 
 He said the recent incidents of rape and gangrape of women below the age of 12 years has shaken the conscience of the entire nation.
 
 Therefore, the offences of rape and gangrape of women under the age of 12-16 years require effective deterrence through legal provisions of more stringent punishment, he said.
 
 During the debate, Deputy Speaker M Thambi Durai, who was in the Chair, suggested that the provisions of the legislation be given maximum publicity, which would act as a deterrence. The Minister agreed to it.
 
 The bill stipulates stringent punishment for perpetrators of rape, particularly of girls below 12 years. Death sentence has been provided for rapists of girls under 12 years.
 
 The minimum punishment in cases of rape of women has been increased from rigorous imprisonment of seven years to 10 years, extendable to life imprisonment, Rijiju said.
 
 According to the bill, in case of rape of a girl under 16 years, the minimum punishment has been increased from 10 to 20 years, extendable to imprisonment for rest of life, which means jail term till the convict's ""natural life"".
 
 The punishment for gangrape of a girl below 16 years will invariably be imprisonment for the rest of life of the convict.
 
 Stringent punishment for rape of a girl under 12 years has been provided with the minimum jail term being 20 years which may go up to life in prison or death sentence. Gangrape of a girl under 12 years of age will invite punishment of jail term for the rest of life or death.
 
 The measure also provides for speedy investigations and trial. The time limit for investigation of all cases of rape has been prescribed, which has to be mandatorily completed within two months.
 
 The deadline for the completion of trial in all rape cases will be two months. A six-month time limit for the disposal of appeals in rape cases has also been prescribed, the bill says, adding that there will also be no provision for anticipatory bail for a person accused of rape or gangrape of a girl under 16 years.
 
 It has also been prescribed that a court has to give notice of 15 days to a public prosecutor and the representative of the victim before deciding on bail applications in case of rape of a girl under 16 years of age.
 
 Participating in the debate, BJP member   said the bill was ""well-timed"" and provides hope for safer future for women.
 
 She said the opposition should not selectively highlight the case of child rape but speak about how to deal with the henious crime.
 
 She was referring to the issue of Kathua rape case which was raised by NK Premachandran (RSP) who had moved a statutory resolution to disapprove the ordinance promulgated by the President on April 21 this year.
 
 Premachandran said it was apalling that a minor girl was gangraped in a temple and brutally murdered thereafter.
 
 Kher said the bill deals with the current reality and lesser than death penalty in case of rape of minor girl cannot be justified.
 
 CPM member PK Sreemathy Teacher asked the Centre to suggest to the state governments to utilise the Rs 3,000 crore Nirbhaya Fund to compensate the child victims.

"India needs 1,023 special courts to try cases of rape and child rape: Govt",2018-07-29T18:18:42+05:30,"NEW DELHI: A little over 1,000 'fast-track special courts' need to be set up across India as part of a new scheme to try cases related to the rape of children and women, the law ministry has estimated.

 
 These courts are to be set up as part of a larger scheme to strengthen the infrastructure for better investigation and swift prosecution in such cases.
 
 The department of justice in the law ministry has estimated an expenditure of Rs 767.25 to set up these special courts. The Centre will have to shell out Rs 474 crore as central funding, the department has told the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).
 
 "" ... It is estimated that a total of 1,023 FTSCs (fast track special courts) are required to be set up for disposing of rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act cases with an estimated expenditure of Rs 767.25 crore out of which Rs 464 crore as central funding on the pattern of centrally sponsored scheme,"" said a law ministry document.
 
 The details worked out by it have been forwarded to the MHA.
 
 The new scheme is part of an ordinance recently promulgated to allow courts to award death penalty to those convicted of raping children aged up to 12 years.
 
 The Criminal Laws (Amendment) Ordinance amended the   (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the Evidence Act and the POCSO Act.
 
 While bringing out the ordinance, the government had decided to frame a scheme to set up an ""appropriate"" number of fast-track courts to try rape cases in the states.
 
 The scheme will include components, including strengthening of the physical infrastructure and prosecution machinery, provision of the required number of judicial officers for lower courts, additional posts of public prosecutors, dedicated investigators and special forensic kits.
 
 A senior government functionary said as many as 524 fast-track courts are already functional in the country to try cases related to women, SCs and STs, the marginalised and senior citizens.
 
 Quoting a written response of law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in Parliament in March 2017, the functionary pointed out that of the 524 fast track courts, 100 are in  , 83 in Uttar Pradesh, 39 in  , 38 in Andhra Pradesh and 34 in  .
 
 The special fast-track courts proposed now as part of the ordinance would specifically deal with rape and child rape cases, the functionary said.
 
 In April, the government had issued an ordinance to provide stringent punishment, including death, for those convicted of raping minors up to the age of 12 years, amid a nationwide outrage over cases of sexual assault and the murder of minors in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua and  's Surat, and the rape of a girl in Unnao in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 New fast-track courts will be set up to deal with such cases and special forensic kits for rape cases will be given to all police stations and hospitals in the long term, according to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance.
 
 It stipulates stringent punishment for perpetrators of rape, particularly of girls below 16 and 12 years. The death sentence has been provided for rapists of girls under 12 years.
 
 The measure also provides for speedy investigation and trial. The time limit for investigation of all cases of rape has been prescribed and has to be now completed within two months.
 
 The deadline for the completion of trial in all rape cases will be two months, officials said. A six-month time limit for the disposal of appeals in rape cases has also been prescribed.
 
 New posts of public prosecutors will be created and special forensic kits for rape cases given to all police stations and hospitals in the long term, the officials said.
 
 Dedicated manpower will be provided for investigation of rape cases in a time-bound manner.
 
 Special forensic labs exclusively for rape cases would also come up in each state.

Man adopts minor only to rape her for year,2018-08-04T07:43:00+05:30,"Ludhiana: After losing her father two years back, an 11-year-old girl from Hoshiarpur district didn’t know that she would land up with a Ludhiana-based family where her “adoptive” father and his father would rape her any day they wanted and her “adoptive” mother would force her into flesh trade. And if that was not all, she was severely thrashed whenever she resisted their moves.

 The man had allegedly been raping the minor for the past one year.
 
 The matter came to light last week when the girl, a student of Class VI at a government school, narrated the incident to her classmates, who further informed schoolteachers and the matter finally reached the police.
 
 Importantly, it is also a matter of investigation whether the couple had legally adopted the girl or not.
 
 Police have arrested the man so far. The couple and man’s father have been booked under Sections 376 (Rape), 120-B (Criminal conspiracy), 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intension) of IPC and under the Prevention of Children from Sexual offences (POCSO) Act has been lodged against couple.
 
 After getting information about the case, the school had first informed NGO Navchetana Child Welfare Committee, Ludhiana Child Helpline and District Child Protection Office. The representatives of these committees had visited the school with their teams to inquire into the matter.
 
 During initial inquiry, it was found that the girl belonged to Hoshiarpur district. After the death of her father a couple of years ago, her mother remarried and shifted to Goraya. There she studied till class IV. But afterwards, she was adopted by a childless couple, based in Ludhiana.
 
 But soon after coming to new home, the adoptive father allegedly started harassing her.
 
 The girl, on whose complaint the police registered a case, told the police that she was brought here by the couple, promising her a good future. “But soon, my adoptive father started sexually harassing me. Later some outsiders started coming home and my adoptive mother allowed them to sexually exploit me. On refusal, I was thrashed by the duo,” the girl said in her complaint.
 
 After suffering silently for a year, the girl dared to share it with her schoolmates who further informed the schoolteachers.
 
 The school principal said, “Shocked over the incident, I called a meeting with all teachers to discuss the matter and informed the district child protection office. The team visited the school on Friday and we lodged a police complaint.”
 
 Inspector Varinder Pal Singh, SHO, said, “The girl has injury marks on her body, which indicate that she was beaten up.”
 
 “On the complaint of the school, the police recorded the statement of 11-year-old girl. The police have also arrested the adoptive father, who works as a security guard with a private company. The adoptive mother is out of town and will be arrested soon. Further the girl has also accused the grandfather, who does not live in the town, for raping her during his visit to the city,” he added.
 
 The inspector said, “The police are also probing if the girl was legally adopted or not. The accused has revealed that the panchayat helped the couple in the adoption, however this is not the legal procedure. The police cannot rule out if the girl was sold to the Ludhiana couple. However, it would be ascertained after investigation.”
 
 The police said the couple had changed the girl's name after bringing her to Ludhiana. They discarded her original Aadhar Card and made a new one with a different name.

 Alleging rampant misuse of the Act, the top court had, on March 20, banned automatic arrests and registration of criminal cases under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989. Before arresting a public servant under the Act, a preliminary probe by an officer not below the rank of deputy superintendent is a must, the court had said. 
 
 A bench comprising Justice Adarsh Goel and Justice UU Lalit had also removed the restrictions on granting anticipatory bail, and imposing a condition that a public servant could be prosecuted only after obtaining permission from the higher authorities.

 Subsequently, the appellant sent another communication from the jail, in which he claimed that was not an adult on the date of the offence—March 25, 2013.
 
 On March 7, the court directed the Pocso judge to conduct an inquiry under the Juvenile Justice Act and submit the report.
 
 The lower court conducted an inquiry by calling in the necessary documents, following the procedure prescribed by the Act, and submitted its report.
 
 It took into consideration the appellant’a birth certificate and concluded that he was a juvenile in 2013.
 
 The court said, “Thus, as the appellant is found to be a juvenile in conflict with law on the date of commission of the offence, he needs to be forwarded to the Juvenile Justice Board for passing appropriate orders, and the sentence, if any, passed by the learned trial court in the matter, shall be deemed to have no effect.”
 
 The court said the appellant should be released from prison if not required in any other case. Further, the record and proceedings are to be placed before the concerned Juvenile Justice Board for passing appropriate orders. It also directed him to appear before the Juvenile Justice Board on September 11.

26-year-old man gets life term for raping minor,2018-07-27T12:45:09+05:30,"LUDHIANA: A 26-year-old man, who is father of two kids, has been awarded life imprisonment for raping a minor girl on the pretext of marriage.

 
 The court of additional sessions judge   Kaur Virk also imposed a fine of Rs 3.5 lakh on the convict, who was found guilty under Section 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) and kidnapping.
 
 On January 30, 2014, Division Number seven police had booked the man under Sections 363 (kidnapping), 366 A (Procuration of minor girl) of the   (IPC) for enticing a minor girl on the pretext of marriage. Later Section 376 (rape) was added in the FIR.
 
 In her complaint to police, the girl’s mother had claimed that her daughter had gone missing on January 29, 2014 after she had gone to a temple to pay obeisance. Later, she came to know that the married man who stayed in the locality had enticed her daughter on the pretext of marriage.
 
 Police had arrested the man on February 24 2014 from a check post at Samrala Chowk and the girl was handed over to her mother.
 
 Later, the police presented the chargesheet in the case for offences punishable under Sections 363, 366 A, 376 of the IPC and 4 of Pocso Act.
 
 During the trial of the case, the accused pleaded innocence and false implication.
 
 The defence counsel contended that prosecution story is doubtful. There are material contradictions in the testimony of prosecutrix and her mother. There is no document to prove the age of prosecutrix. In the absence of age proof, the offence can’t fall under Section 4, Pocso Act.
 
 The defence counsel had said the prosecutrix had a love affair with the accused. Besides, her family had borrowed Rs10,000 from the accused’s wife. When accused and his wife demanded the money back, a dispute rose between the two families. Due to said reason, the accused was falsely implicated in this case.
 
 The court observed the defence plea that accused had a love affair with the prosecutrix and she used to roam with him with her free consent, led to the inference that the accused did not completely deny the occurrence but has taken the plea of his consensual relation with her.
 
 The court on the basis of record maintained with   also observed that the girl was minor aged 17 years and 7 months on the date of alleged occurrence.
 
 The court said when the girl was below 18 years of age at the time of alleged occurrence, the question of consent is immaterial.
 
 Box: ‘Punishment doesn’t depend on social status’
 
 In a special observation, the court said, “These days sexual offences against women and children are on the rise, because of which there is a lot of resentment in the society. In this case the victim was minor girl at the time of incident. The measure of punishment in a case of rape cannot depend on the social status of the rape survivor or the accused. It must depend on the conduct of the accused, the state and age of the victim and gravity of the criminal act. Crimes of violence upon women or children need to be severely dealt with. The convict does not deserve to live in civilized society.”

Muzaffarpur rape case: Police set to quiz government officials,2018-07-28T08:43:12+05:30,"PATNA: Serious questions are being raised on the intentions of social welfare department officials behind shifting all the 44 girl inmates from   government children home (balika grih) before lodging an FIR against the accused in their sexual and physical abuse case.

 A senior IPS officer of state, preferring anonymity, said the 44 girls were shifted from Muzaffarpur on May 30, a day before the FIR was lodged with the women’s police station on May 31. “This creates doubts on the intentions of the social welfare department officials as it was a clear case of tampering with the evidence,” he said.
 
 In addition, he also raised questions on those who “inspected” the shelter home at regular intervals and kept submitting report that everything was “fine” there. “Just a month before the matter surfaced, the officials had inspected the children home and reported that everything was fine there,” he said.
 
 A social audit report of Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS, Mumbai), which was submitted to the state social welfare department in April, had indicated violent sexual and physical abuse of girls at the government-funded home run by NGO Seva Sankalp Ewam Vikas Samiti. The medical reports confirmed rape with the 29 of the 44 girls.
 
 “The department also sat on the TISS report for over a month after receiving it on April 27,” he added.
 
  high court advocate Shama Sinha, who is representing a PIL filed in the matter, also raised the question as how TISS officials came to know about the sordid affair at the balika grih even during their visit there for a couple of hours, but the government officials, who periodically inspected the home, did not find anything wrong.
 
 Sources say every official, who had visited the Muzaffarpur home for any reason, would be interrogated in the case. “They are the next in line to be quizzed before CBI takes over the investigation after lodging an FIR,” sources said.
 
 Meanwhile, the Muzaffarpur police submitted its first chargesheet in the case against ten accused, including NGO owner Brajesh Thakur, on Thursday. Nine other accused are child protection officer Ravi Kumar Raushan, child welfare committee member Vikash Kumar and NGO office-bearers Kiran Devi, Chanda Devi, Neha Kumari, Manju Devi, Indu Kumari, Hema Masih and Meenu Devi.

 A petition seeking anticipatory bail was filed by 45-year-old Anil Mithra of Haripad in the case registered by Adoor police on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim to state police chief.
 
 After considering the petition, the court said a perusal of the case diary shows that the alleged offence is prima facie true. The court also noted that the petitioner had threatened to destroy the victim’s family. Police has informed that the victim filed a complaint to the state police chief himself as the accused is influential, the court said.
 
 Anil Mithra, who was first elected in 2000, had been continuously winning the local elections to the municipality for the last 18 years. He has an unblemished track record as a public person with proven integrity, the petition had stated.
 
 The victim had joined the municipality’s ICDS as a project officer in 2015 and had worked there from December 2015 to August last year. As a councilor, the petitioner had associated with various activities of ICDS and the victim had sought his help in conducting various programmes of ICDS. She was living with her husband and she had availed financial assistance from the petitioner and other councilors, the petition said.
 
 While she was very prompt in repayment at the initial stage, she started defaulting and he did not extend any further financial help, the councilor’s petition said. She had also sought help in her transfer to Thiruvananthapuram but he could not extend any help due to the change in government, he stated in the petition.
 
 Totally denying the allegations regarding sexual molestation and rape, the councilor said such allegations are inherently improbable and that the allegations are vague. The complaint does not pinpoint any incident, he had contended.
 
 A complaint has been filed now so as to blackmail him and extract money, the councilor had alleged. The complainant had participated in the marriage of his niece in August last year and had blessed the couple, the councilor had pointed out by producing a photograph from the wedding function.

 Kala Singh of Rupawali village in Haryana’s Fatehabad district had raped the child and then strangled her on the night of May 11, 2016 after kidnapping her from a wedding he had gone to attend in a Mansa village, where the victim and her family lived.
 
 While sentencing Kala Singh, additional sessions judge Jaspal Verma said the crime was the rarest of rare cases and fit for death sentence. “I have arrived at conclusion that there is no mitigating circumstance to avoid death penalty for the accused. There are so many aggravating circumstances due to which the case falls in the rarest of rare cases to invite capital punishment,” the judge said.
 
 Giving reasons for awarding death penalty, the judge said the accused was a relative, although a distant one, of the girl. He had planned the crime and had kept the child on his lap the whole day during the wedding function to win her confidence, he added.
 
 The judge concluded that if the convict could kidnap, rape and murder a girl related to him, he could go to any extent and thus was a danger to the society.
 
 The death penalty would, however, be subject to confirmation by the Punjab and Haryana high court.
 
 The judge also directed the convict to pay a fine of Rs 50,000, failing which he would undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year, in case his death sentence was not confirmed by the high court.
 
 The Union cabinet on April 21 passed an ordinance recommending death penalty for rapists of girls below 12 years of age. The ordinance was approved by the President on April 22. The Punjab cabinet adopted the law on June 27.
 
 The death sentence by the Mansa court is first death penalty in Punjab for the rape of a minor after the law was adopted by the state.

Offspring’s DNA nails man for raping minor daughter: HC,2018-07-25T03:02:00+05:30,"Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Tuesday maintained the conviction of a father for raping his own minor daughter, based on the DNA test of his granddaughter. Interestingly, the survivor and her mother had turned hostile and refused to implicate petitioner Salim Ahmed, a resident of Yashodhara Nagar here. The survivor had delivered a girl child out of the heinous act, which had happened over a long time. However, the child’s DNA nailed the accused, as it proved that Ahmed was her biological father. “Merely because the prosecutrix and her mother turned hostile, it can’t lead to acquittal of the accused. It’s indeed sad and poignant that despite such a reprehensible act committed by him against his own daughter, both chose not to support the prosecution’s case. But the scientific evidence in the form of DNA test report nailed the father’s guilt,” justice Manish Pitale held. Ahmed, who was convicted under Section 376 of IPC, and Section 5 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO), had challenged his conviction in HC. He was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a Rs10,000 fine by the sessions court here. Citing Supreme Court verdict, justice Pitale said, “To deny the DNA test report would be to deny the truth, and the hallmark of justice is ‘truth must triumph’.” Public prosecutor Swati Kolhe said the case came to fore when the minor fell ill and it was revealed during her medical exam that she was pregnant. She later revealed to her mother that the father had forced himself on her in March 2014 and continued it for five months till she became ill. The FIR was lodged on August 28, when it came to light that she was five months pregnant. During investigations, the DNA samples of father, daughter and child were sent for testing, which confirmed that Ahmed is the biological father of the newborn. However, both mother and survivor turned hostile, as Ahmed was the only breadwinner in the house and it would have been difficult for them to survive on their own, Kolhe informed. “The evidence and material on record clearly demonstrates the prosecution has conclusively proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant. The trial court was justified in convicting and sentencing the appellant under the IPC and POCSO Act,” the HC ruled."

Karsan Bhanushali, who is father-in-law of the former MLA’s daughter, submitted in his application that the complainant woman had links with Priya, one of the accused woman in an extortion complaint registered at Surat crime branch in December 2017.  The crime branch sources informed that the rape complainant was called to register her statement on May 28, 2018 because her name was taken by other accused in the case relating to extortion calls to Congress leader Dinesh Kachhadiya.  “Since the woman did not come to register her statement, we had issued her another summons recently. She was in touch with some accused arrested in the complaint by Kachhadiya,” said a police officer in crime branch. A video of a man looking like Kachhadiya had gone viral on social media a day before polling for assembly elections on December 9, 2017. Kachhadiya, who was Congress candidate from Surat North assembly constituency, claimed in his complaint that the man with a woman in the video was not him. The rape complainant in a press briefing on Tuesday claimed that she doesn’t know any woman named Priya Mer but does know one Priya Mehra. The rape accused’s relative Karsan Bhanushali has claimed in his application that Priya, one of the accused in the complaint lodged by Kachhaidya, had introduced the rape survivor to the former. In Ahmedabad, a man claiming to be the rape complainant’s husband accused Kutch BJP lader Chhabil Patel of having relations with her and threatening him over phone.  Patel, however, said he was unnecessarily being dragged into the controversy by Bhanushali . Talking to reporters in Gandhinagar, Patel, a former Congress MLA from Abdasa, who joined BJP in 2014, said, “I am being framed for political reasons by Bhanushali who has been targeting me ever since I joined the BJP.”  “I don't know this person who claims to be former husband of the woman. He has been brought forward by Bhanushali to defame me. I challenge the man to face narco test along with me.” Patel said he would lodge a complaint with party against Bhanushali and approach cops against the man. The rape survivor said she does not know Chhabil Patel, who her former husband, alleged had instigated her.

 The crime branch was asked to submit its reply after the lawyers of the accused had filed a plea before the court, saying that they should be informed in advance about the witnesses by the prosecution.
 
 “We submitted the application on behalf of the crime branch in which we have highlighted why the names of witnesses cannot be disclosed in advance. This includes intimidation of witnesses, their security.
 
 “We have highlighted how the defence lawyers were misleading about the trial as well. We plan to move another application tomorrow to inform the court how the defence lawyers were misleading the public by giving out wrong information,” special public prosecutor J K Chopra told PTI.
 
 He said the trial court would soon be taking a decision on the application submitted by the crime branch.

 Capital punishment will evoke awe and send shock waves only when it is based on truth and evidence and the same would lose its sanctity and severity when it is perverse and peddled frequently by every trial court for fear of indictment from outside sources, said Justice Vimala.

 Stringent punishment for rape of a girl under 12 years has been provided with the minimum jail term being 20 years which may go up to life in prison or death sentence. Gangrape of a girl under 12 years of age will invite punishment of jail term for the rest of life or death.
 
 The measure also provides for speedy investigations and trial. The time limit for investigation of all cases of rape has been prescribed, which has to be mandatorily completed within two months.
 
 The deadline for the completion of trial in all rape cases will be two months. A six-month time limit for the disposal of appeals in rape cases has also been prescribed.

 A particular spot at the shelter home ground on Sahu Road was dug up by civic body workers in presence of Muzaffarpur SP P K Mandal, DSP Mukul Ranjan, Mahila police station SHO Jyoti Kumari and a magistrate.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 The shelter home hit the headlines after Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Social Studies in a social audit report on May 30 talked about sexual exploitation of its inmates. An FIR was lodged the next day and ten arrests were subsequently made.
 
 Of the 44 inmates staying in the shelter home when the FIR was lodged, 42 were medically examined. “Medical reports have confirmed rape of 29 girls. While while five reports were negative, reports of eight girls are yet to be received,” a police officer said, adding two girls could not be examined due to health issues.
 
  
  
 
 
 Muzaffarpur   Harpreet Kaur told this reporter over the phone the digging was carried out after an inmate said one girl was beaten to death and buried at the Balika Kendra by the shelter home employees. “The survivor said she had come to know about the girl’s death from ‘house mother’ Kiran Devi,” the SSP said.
 
 The 40-uear-old ‘house mother’ is among those already arrested. ”It could be possible that the house mother, alleged by the shelter home girls to be a lesbian, concocted the death story to scare the girls into acquiescing for sex with her and other men,” the SSP said and added, however, that police would undertake more digging exercises if any of the survivors provided further inputs.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 The SSP said another survivor said she saw the deceased girl’s body being bundled into a bag. But she was not sure where the body was buried. “We even showed her the register containing the name and picture of all the girls, but she couldn’t identify the ‘kiiled’ girl,” said Kaur.
 
 The arersted people include shelter home functionaries Brajesh Thakur, Ravi Kumar and Vikash Kumar as well as seven women.
 
  
  
 
 
 Sources said police investigations so far had found the accusation against the arrested people true. The girls were given certain medicines before they were sexually abused by the shelter home personnel as well as outsiders. Further probe is on, the sources said.

Because if I have gotten into any sort of trouble where I have felt that someone has spoken to me with disrespect or in this situation, a sexual assault or a sexual abuse or anything indicative towards that manner, I feel I would have entertained some part of it”.

 Responding strongly to Mamta’s statements,   called the actress out and posted on social media: “Dear Mamtha Mohandas and my sisters and brothers and LGBTQ community out there who have been through harassment and assaults and molestations and rapes in life. You are not responsible when you get troubled, cat-called, assualted, molested, abused, harassed, violated, attacked, kidnapped or raped. The molester, assaulter, aggressor, violater, kidnapper or the rapist is responsible. A society that normalises these wrongs is responsible. A world that protects the wrong doer is responsible.”
 
 The actress made it clear that people should “continue to speak out and stand up for each other. Let's break that wall of silence and ignorance”.
 
 
 
 Replying to Rima, Mamta had posted, “Thank you for your opinion. I understand what a woman faces in Society in every way. Not that I’m a victim of rape. But I am A woman who lives in the same society which has natural imbalances which finds it easy to make women feel like the weaker sex and silence us and trust me, I Have felt disrespected abused and assaulted by a few men whom I have trusted and counted on. So it’s the same effect on the woman whether the mans a stranger or someone known to us. 
 
 “Dear WOMEN.. please don’t turn against WOMEN who scream from their insides. Think before you react. In short what I lack isn’t empathy or IQ… what I LACK GREATLY NOW IS FORGIVENESS TO WRONG DOERS. Ask Justice to HANG them once convicted rapist. No second chances. Women please make noise and react and DO NOT ALLOW HISTORY TO REPEAT. POINT FINGERS AT THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM BEFORE CALLING OUT ON EACH OTHER (sic).”

 “The cardinal informed us that the nun had informed him about some issues at her convent for which he asked her to approach the concerned congregation. However, he did not receive a complaint about sexual abuse,” said Subash, adding that the cardinal fully cooperated with the investigation.
 
 The scandal, which initially rocked the Catholic Church, eventually became a crisis as the nun claimed that her complaint to several authorities (regarding sexual abuse) was left unaddressed, after which she was forced to approach the police.
 
 Meanwhile, the cardinal’s office informed that head of the Syro Malabar Church is offering full support to law enforcement agencies. Earlier, an official communiqué was issued from his office which denied that a complaint of sexual assault was received against the bishop of Jalandhar.
 
 “It is unclear from media reports who is this nun. However, a nun working with Jalandhar   had met the cardinal and complained about some appointments and transfers in her congregation and the inconveniences she faced. Since her congregation belonged to Jalandhar diocese, which comes under the Latin hierarchy, she was advised to approach it as the cardinal had no jurisdiction,” stated the communique.
 
 The communique had also stated that on November 23, 2017, the father of a nun working with Jalandhar diocese gave a letter to the cardinal about some difficulties faced by his daughter at her congregation.

 Other than Monserrate (then St Cruz MLA), the survivor’s neighbour is the other accused in the chargesheet, filed before the district and sessions court, Panaji.
 
 According to the complaint by the suvivor, it was the neighbour who convinced her mother to take her to Monserrate, on the assurance that the politician would ‘take care of them’.
 
 Monserrate is currently out on bail. Probe in the case was completed by end of 2016, but the police had been waiting for reports of the evidence material sent to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory ( ) for testing before they could file a chargesheet in the case.
 
 
 
 
 The minor’s cell phone and a bedsheet from Monserrate’s house had been sent for testing.
 
 When the FIR was filed, charges under Goa Children’s Act were added.
 
 But following an ossification test of the girl, she was found to be above the age of 16 when the alleged rape took place and therefore the Sections under Goa Children’s Act do not apply and have been dropped, officials said.
 
 But other than being chargesheeted for rape under Section 376 of the  , Section 506 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences ( ) Act has been applied as the girl was under 18 years at the time of the rape.
 
 The survivor was initially housed at the state protective home Apna Ghar and is currently in safe custody under the supervision of the child welfare committee, officials said.
 
 The accused have also been booked under Section 67 (b) and (c) of the Informatoin Technology (IT) Act for use of a cell phone in the alleged crime and for possessing photographs of the survivor on a cell phone.
 
 The district and sessions court, Panaji, where the chargesheet has been filed, will now begin the procedure for framing of charges in the case, following which the case proceedings will begin.

 Talking to TOI on Thursday, the survivor's elder sister and mother said the family moved out of the neighbourhood where the crime happened. 
 
  ""My girl has been complaining of severe body pain. We have taken her out of her school till the police formalities get over,"" said the mother.
 
 The sister said she suspected something was wrong when he saw lift operator Ravi Kumar touching the younger girl's hand in a strange way.

 She informed the parents and they approached the Secretariat Colony police station. The complaint was later forwarded to the Ayanavaram all-woman police station.
 
 Senior counsel S Ananthanarayanan, who is representing the girl in court, said the accused had threatened the girl with knives and given her sedatives before sexually assaulting her repeatedly.
 
 Activist Apsara Reddy said she was helping the family which is clueless while dealing with police and child welfare committee officials.

 On information that the accused had sedated the girl repeatedly, police teams have been making inquiries at pharmacies in and around Secretariat Colony and Ayanavaram about people who have bought prescription drugs, especially sedatives. 
 
 The security guard is suspected to have bought these drugs from a nearby pharmacy.
 
 Police said it was the 60-year-old lift operator, Ravi Kumar, who started the assault. He later brought in his acquaintances, who also raped the girl. 
 
 Ravikumar had earlier worked at a maternity hospital, where he reportedly learned about the use of certain medicines.

"Rape survivor argues own case at Kerala HC, wins",2018-07-17T19:40:36+05:30,"KOCHI: The   has quashed a case falsely-foisted upon a rape survivor by men allegedly employed by her rapist to prevent her from attending the proceedings in the rape case. The survivor had argued the case herself in court.

  had registered the case against the 30-year-old survivor, who is a doctor, on a complaint filed by 34-year-old   last year. The 30-year-old survivor, who is a doctor, was accused of slapping Rajeesh on the right cheek and calling him a ‘bastard’ after parking her car on a public road. The incident had allegedly occurred while police personnel, who were summoned by the doctor, were present at the scene. On the doctor’s complaint, a case was registered against Rajeesh and others stating that they had obstructed her while she was taking her car out of her house and had verbally abused her.
 
 It was argued by the survivor that the case was falsely registered against her and that the alleged incident, and similar others prior to it, occurred in the days immediately preceding the proceedings in the rape case. The intention of the accused is to prevent her from appearing in the main case and proceed with the trial and they are acting as instructed by the rape-case accused, the survivor had alleged. She had also pointed out that one of the accused in the scuffle had earlier approached her with an offer from the rape-case accused to settle the case.
 
 In the judgment quashing the case against the survivor, justice   cited discrepancy between the first information statement of Rajeesh and the wound certificate issued by the doctor who treated him immediately after the alleged incident. The Rajeesh’s statement said he was slapped on the right cheek, the doctor noticed tenderness on both sides of the face. The court said it is a suspicious circumstance and also noted that the police person and other persons of the locality, who were allegedly present there, were not cited as witnesses.
 
 Further, the court said calling someone ‘bastard’ cannot be said to be obscene by no stretch of imagination and the offence of uttering obscenity charged against the petitioner is not sustainable.
 
 Asked why she chose to argue the case herself, the survivor told TOI, “Nobody can present facts correlating with documents and evidence better than one who experienced it. My experience in court '3C' that awaited afternoon was fulfilling and are moments I will never forget. I'm ever grateful to Justice Abraham Mathew for hearing my arguments and analysing the facts. With the questions asked to the respondent's advocate, I understood that the Judge had taken effort to go through the draft prior to the hearing which was a blessing & relief for me, since I realized I had forgotten to mention two main points in being nervous. On knowing the result, I felt my body and mind thank me. It cost me a lot, but I hope this will be a lesson to those assailants and the corrupted local police to dare repeat it again.”
 
 She also complained that Social Justice Department of the state government provided no help to her despite promising it earlier. “Social justice department did nothing and such bodies are sadly for namesake and non-functional. I state this with no shame to admit facts. This is also a dangerous fact as it helps promote crime by instilling confidence to assailants of inaction of authorities. I had travelled to Trivandrum and met   (IPS) at Police HQ even before this case was 'charge-sheeted', also contacted her as matters kept getting worse but ironically she involves in 'victim shaming' as an excuse to not do her part. On learning this, I further reported it to their department by registered posts with acknowledgement, with no avail. It’s important not to be disheartened on knowing certain authorities don’t function as expected to,” the survivor said.

Nursery kid rape: DM says ‘lifeguard’ not police-verified,2018-07-18T04:48:21+05:30,"GREATER NOIDA: The   school where a   student was allegedly raped by a “pool lifeguard” didn’t get a   verification done of the accused despite hiring him over a decade ago, the district magistrate has said. 

 
 The accused, Chandi Das, who had been hired as a pump operator, would double as an attendant to students during horse-riding sessions and man the pool when kids went for swimming. 
 
 Following the death of a student in a   school in September last year, the Gautam Budh Nagar administration had made it mandatory for all schools to send a list of documents identifying its employees. “Despite stressing on police verification of all employees, several schools have been found to have not done it. 
 
 Even the school where this incident has taken place hadn’t got the accused verified. He has been working there for over 10 years,” the district magistrate, BN Singh, said during a meeting with principals of several schools in the district. “I have also been told that a lot of people come and work in the schools with visitors’ cards. 
 
 We will have to verify this,” he added. Singh has formed a committee to examine security arrangements for students at the Greater Noida school. The principal of the school where the alleged rape took place declined to comment, saying the allegation was being probed. 
 
 The principals of some other schools, however, said that police verification was a time-taking process and a number of their applications was awaiting approval. Agroup of parents, especially those whose children are in the junior wing, said they would not send their kids to the school where the alleged rape took place for the time being. The parents of the three and a half year old child said she was still traumatised and crying intermittently. The parents said they were talking to her continuously to make her forget the incident.

Pocso mandates completion of in-camera trial within three months.

 
 Most of the accused are watchmen, plumbers and water can delivery boys either working in or frequenting the apartment complex where the girl lives with her parents. Police plan to file the chargesheeet before the suspects get bail; they would conduct an identification parade inside Puzhal central jail soon, said officials. For now, the men have been remanded in judicial custody till July 31.
 
  
 Police would also register statements under Section 164 of CrPC in the presence of a magistrate so that none of the accused backtracks during deposition. Officers are also checking if the suspects had targeted any other child in the neighbourhood.

"Kathua rape and murder trial: Cop ‘washed’ dress, ‘concocted’ evidence",2018-07-18T14:39:38+05:30,"A Jammu & Kashmir policeman has accused his senior of not depositing clothes of the eight-year-old victim in the   and murder case to the malkhana, or warehouse, of the police station so as to tamper with the evidence.

 Head constable Surinder Pal, during his examination in the trial court on Monday, further alleged that sub inspector Anand Dutta also intimidated him to record backdated entries when he submitted “concocted” evidence the following day.
 
 Dutta is a co-accused in the case over abduction, rape and murder of the nomad   girl in Rasana village in January.
 
 Pal has deposed that Dutta had come to the Hiranagar police station on January 18 with three pieces of evidence — a hair band,   (long scarf), and shoes of the deceased.
 
 As per procedure, every case property after being sealed by the investigative agency is to be deposited in the malkhana of the concerned police station. But Dutta did not deposit the evidence he had brought. On January 19, Dutta again came to the station with three pieces — ash, astone and a lock & key, Pal said.
 
 Jammu & Kashmir Crime Branch, which is investigating the case, has alleged that Dutta had concocted these three pieces of evidence to confuse the investigation and disprove the theory that the girl was kept in a ‘devasthan’ (temple).
 
 Dutta had claimed to his seniors that the girl was instead kept in a cow shed close to the devasthan. Besides these, Dutta also made four packets of evidence labelled ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’. Packet A contained blood stained clay recovered from the place where the girl’s dead body was found.
 
 Packet B contained clay sample, and packet C contained swabs recovered from the body. Packet D was supposed to contain the clothes of the deceased, containing blood stains and smeared with clay.
 
 Pal has alleged that Dutta directed him to make backdated entries in record to show that all the pieces of evidence, including the four packets, were deposited in the malkhana on January 17 and 18.
 
 However, Dutta never deposited the clothes in packet D, the investigative agency claimed. Instead, he washed the dress the eight-year-old victim was wearing at the time of her death to clean the blood stains and clay with the help of a head constable Tilak Raj, who is also a co-accused in the case now, agency insiders have alleged.
 
 The dress sent for examination to the forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), along with samples of clay recovered from the ground where the body was recovered, was totally clean. Crime Branch officials were shocked when FSL experts informed them that the two did not match.
 
 
 
 Pathankot: The row over the “disappearance of evidence” in trial has been clarified by the prosecution. On Monday, the prosecution opened a sealed box containing evidence and hair strands of the deceased. However, the packets were found empty. The agency officials then contacted the director of the Forensic Science Laboratory who conveyed that as per procedure, the hair samples were “consumed” for examination.

 The scheme envisages hike in payment of compensation to survivors of acid attack, sexual harassment, including rape, and human trafficking from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 7 lakh.
 
 “It also stipulates payment of Rs 10,000 per month to acid attack survivors for whole life in case of higher degree of injury such as damage to the entire face or eyes,” special secretary (cabinet coordination) Upendra Nath Pandey told reporters after the cabinet meet.
 
 Pandey said an initial corpus fund of Rs 2.5 lakh would be created in every district in order to provide immediate assistance and aid to such survivors. The scheme has been formulated as per the Centre’s guidelines, he said.
 
 The Union ministry of home affairs introduced the Central Victim Compensation Fund (CVCF) with an initial corpus fund of Rs 200 crore in October 2015 to facilitate support to survivors of various attacks. It envisages payment of compensation on the grounds of injuries and death with respect to acid attack, rape and human trafficking etc.
 
 Among other objectives, the CVCF sought to reduce disparity in quantum of compensation notified by different states for victims of similar crimes.
 
 The Centre accordingly urged the states to modify their victim compensation schemes to reduce disparity in quantum of compensation and claim financial support from the CVCF scheme.
 
 “The new scheme shows the government is sensitive on this issue... The government should also come up with stringent laws against the culprits so that such heinous crimes can be prevented,” said Patna-based A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies’s Prof D M Diwakar.
 
 Meanwhile, the state cabinet also approved three other decisions at its meeting on Tuesday, including a one-year service extension of 40 junior engineers of the water resources department and nine junior engineers of the building construction department.

"Doon rape: Parents of survivor, accused kids nonplussed as experts blame it lack of sex education",2018-07-18T11:45:18+05:30,"DEHRADUN: A day after reports about gangrape of an eight-year-old girl by five boys, the youngest of whom is nine, in Sahaspur area of Dehradun emerged, neighbours in this small locality were left shocked and wondering just how “could a bunch of young, studious boys” commit such a crime. The offence, said to have been perpetrated by the boys after watching porn on a mobile, has set off debates about easy accessibility to pornographic matter, a limited understanding in children to the risks of sexual abuse and an increasing sexualisation of kids.

 A visit to the village, which is situated around 25 km from the state capital, reveals a sleepy, little hamlet with rows of houses making space for people from various backgrounds and faith systems. The families of the accused boys, all neighbours of the survivor, could not believe that the unspeakable crime was committed in one of their houses.
 
 “One of the boys lives opposite her house and had taken her inside. The two families have lived here for generations and the children have grown up together. We do not know what crossed the boys’ minds. They used to play together with the girl,” said the survivor’s aunt.
 
 The gangrape, which was committed on Friday, was reported to police only on Sunday. A student of class V, the minor survivor was lured inside the house while she was playing outside. According to police, one of the boys said that they had watched a porn movie and planned to gangrape her.
 
 Naresh Rathore, station house officer (SHO) of Sahaspur police station, said, “The boys knew that the girl stayed alone during that period of the day. They lured her with a chocolate on Sunday and raped her. One of them stood guard while the others took turns to   the minor.”
 
 Child counsellors have pointed towards shocking incidences of premature sexualisation in children, combined with easy access to online pornography, as some of the major reasons behind such crimes. “Children going through hormonal changes are more likely to emulate sex scenes shown in pornographic movies. Lack of   could lead to things taking a twisted turn,” said Ritambhara Dwivedi, child counsellor at a private school.
 
 Experts also blame   and parents shying away from having discussions with children for a rise in incidents of rape involving children. The families of the accused boys said they couldn’t believe their children would do something like this. “They have been framed,” said the father of one of the minors.
 
 “My son was good in studies and we do not even have a smartphone. How could he have watched porn,” asked the father of one of the accused boys.
 
 Sona Kaushal, a city-based neuropsychologist, said, “Lack of communication between parents and their kids is one of the primary causes why the former remain clueless about what their children are up to. Children of certain ages are very impressionable and need proper guidance. Parents should talk to their kids more often and keep a vigil on their activities online.”

 Some parents claimed that Chandi Das, who was arrested last week, would double as an attendant to students during horse-riding sessions and man the school’s pool during swimming classes. When the principal was asked if Das knew swimming, she replied: “The pool is only knee-deep. Moreover, we have a trained coach for swimming classes.”
 
 Police said several areas of the school were not covered by CCTV cameras, including the corridor between the changing room and the pool.
 
 Police confirmed Das did not have any certificate to prove his swimming abilities. “He did not have any certificate. But whether he knew swimming or not is a matter of investigation,” said Manoj Pant, SHO of Surajpur police station.
 
 A video being circulated on social media shows Das telling a group of mediapersons he “committed a mistake”. “Sir, I was in the pool. I made a mistake,” he can be heard saying.
 
 A police team probing the rape has pointed out several flaws in security measures adopted by the school. “There is no CCTV camera in the corridor between the changing room and swimming pool,” said Amit Srivastava, circle officer,   1.
 
 The district magistrate has formed a five-member team to inspect safety arrangements for students at the school and submit a report in two weeks.
 
 Parents and students, too, claimed the school did not adopt proper measures to ensure the students’ safety during swimming classes. Some students said no female attendant would accompany them for the swimming sessions. “This man (Chandi Das) would be present near the swimming pool and also during horse riding sessions,” a student said.
 
 A parent of a nursery student said children would be asked to change their costumes in the class itself.
 
 The principal, who had earlier said there was no concrete evidence to prove the allegation against Das, faced a barrage of questions on Monday from around 300 parents protesting the alleged rape on the school premises.
 
 “The principal had told us multiple times during orientation lectures that the school will not allow any male employee near the junior wing. But my daughter has often told me she is picked up by a man whenever she falls inside the pool. What Chandi Das was doing inside the pool is clear from this picture,” said a parent, holding a picture showing the accused near the pool.
 
 Later in the day, the principal addressed a gathering of parents, accompanied by a posse of policemen. “Why was a male member present near the pool? Why no CCTV cameras were at the spot?” asked a parent.
 
 “If we do not pay fees for a day, we are charged a penalty. Why are we sending our children to this school? The principal did not answer any of the questions,” claimed another parent.
 
 Asked later about Das, the principal said: “He had been employed as a pump operator at the swimming pool. We have a regular coach for training children.”

  The incident had come to light on July 8 after which an FIR was lodged with the Women’s police station on July 10. It was due to delay in lodging FIR and giving wrong information to seniors that Women's police station SHO Bibha Kumari was suspended by DIG (central range) Rajesh Kumar soon after the FIR was lodged.
 
  Newly appointed SHO Ravi Ranjana said that after investigations made till now, it surfaced that the incident actually took place on July 1 when the minor had gone near a government hand-pump near the slums located beside railway tracks at road number 31.
 
  “The accused, hardly 12-year-old, had forcibly taken the victim to a secluded place in the area covered by bushes where he had raped her,” SHO Ranjana said.
 
  She said that the matter remained under blanket as accused’s family were paying money for the treatment and medicines for the victim after the incident.
 
  “Even the victim’s family chose to keep the matter away from police due to social stigma,” she said.
 
  “It was after they stopped paying money and the child was not receiving proper medical attention, the victim’s family approached police,” she said.
 
  She said that the accused’s father died almost four years back and his mother collects honey from different area. The SHO said the accused was continually changing his location until he was caught from his maternal uncle’s house in Salimpur. “The minor girl’s parents are daily wagers,” Ranjana said.
 
  When asked, the SHO said that it was yet not clear that what instigated the boy to commit such a heinous crime.
 
  “Only after further investigation, it would surface that if he was in wrong circle or used to watch pornographic materials on cellphone,” she said.
 
  Ranjana said the accused is inconsistent in his statements. “He has confessed his crime but said that he doesn’t know how things happened. Several things including his mental condition needs to me medically examined to ensure if inconsistency in statement was due to his situation or he was misleading police,” SHO Ranjana said.

3-year-old raped by Greater Noida school staffer,2018-07-15T01:40:50+05:30,"GREATER NOIDA: A 42-year-old employee of a well-known English medium school in   has been arrested on charges of raping a nursery student after the girl’s parents filed a police complaint last Friday.

 
 The man taken into custody is Chandi Das, a lifeguard who mans the school’s pool during swimming classes for students. He is from Burdwan in West Bengal, police said. He has been charged under Section 376 of the IPC and sections of Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO). Das was arrested on Friday. The girl is three and a half years old.
 
 The school’s principal has, however, claimed the complaint is a false one, saying CCTV footage did not back up the accusation against Das. 
 
 The child’s parents went to the police after she complained of pain and a medical examination confirmed sexual assault. The FIR also mentions the medico-legal examination finding that the hymen of the girl was torn. The complaint filed by the parents says the child had gone to school on Thursday at 8.30am and returned around 1.50pm. On coming home, the child started complaining of pain. When the pain did not subside, her parents took her to GTB hospital. The girl’s father told TOI on Saturday they do not know if she informed her class teacher.
 
 The parents alleged the sexual assault happened during school hours as the child was happy when she went to school. “The swimming sessions happen early in the morning between 9 and 10am on a weekly basis. Children enrolled for the classes are taken near the pool together and are trained one by one,” the girl’s father said.
 
 Manoj Pant, SHO of Surajpur police station where the complaint was filed, said the girl had identified Das in front of a police team. “When we went to the school the next day (Friday), she started crying, pointing towards the lifeguard,” he said. Das is a contractual employee of the school who works as a lifeguard. He stays in a rented accommodation in a society in the Kasna area with his family, police said. He has a son.
 
 The school’s principal said while she has not seen CCTV footage from the day herself, a committee of teachers and the police have. “We found there was no conclusive evidence that the lifeguard has performed any act which he is being accused of,” she said.
 
 Asked about the footage, Pant told TOI Das was in the footage when the child was being taken to the classroom after swimming class. “It can be seen that the children are being taken to the classroom for changing their clothes and not the changing room. There is no CCTV camera in the classroom,” the SHO said. Investigators said they had “sealed” CCTV footage of the incident so that it cannot be tampered with.
 
 A police officer who went to the school with the parents told TOI the school had vouched for the character of Das. “They said they have never received any complaint from anyone against him and he had been working for many years,” the officer said.
 
 Reacting to the school’s and principal’s statements, the girl’s father said the medical report had been given to the police. “How can such an incident occur with a three-and-a half-year-old child inside school premises?” he said.

"Will Amit Shah apologise for UP BJP MLA's remark on rape, asks Sena",2018-07-13T14:12:16+05:30,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Friday asked whether BJP president Amit Shah would apologise for his party's UP MLA's remark that even Lord Ram cannot curb rapes.

 
 The Sena's poser came a day after the BJP sought an apology from Congress president Rahul Gandhi for  's 'Hindu  ' remark.
 
 ""Tharoor said if the BJP wins the 2019 (Lok Sabha) polls, India will become 'Hindu Pakistan'. In short, if (Narendra) Modi is voted to power again, India will be declared a Hindu rashtra (nation).
 
 ""This is RSS's agenda, which Tharoor has only expressed from the Congress platform,"" the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ' '.
 
 The Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram, Tharoor, had set off a political controversy on Wednesday with his remark that if voted to power again, the BJP will rewrite the Constitution and pave the way for creation of a ""Hindu Pakistan"".
 
 
 On Thursday, the BJP had demanded an apology from Gandhi for the ""attack on Indian democracy and Hindus"".
 
 ""The BJP wants Congress president Gandhi to apologise for Tharoor's remarks. But one needs to understand that Tharoor is only speaking the language of the BJP,"" the Sena said.
 
 ""One of its MLAs Surendra Narayan Singh had said even Lord Ram cannot curb rapes. His statement is an insult to Hindus. Shouldn't BJP chief Amit Shah apologise for his remark?"" it said.
 
 BJP MLA from Bairia in Uttar Pradesh, Singh, had recently said, ""Bhagwan Ram bhi aa jaayenge, tab bhi balaatkaar ki ghatna per niyantran nahi ho paayegaa (The incidents of rape cannot be curbed, even if Lord Ram descends on earth)"".
 
 The Sena said, ""India was divided because of the Congress. That party is responsible for the division. If Pakistan was founded on the basis of religious identity, then Hindustan is a Hindu rashtra.""
 
 ""The   always accused (Jawaharlal) Nehru, (Sardar) Patel and others of turning Hindustan into a 'secular' state. If Nehru and others had committed this mistake, then the country gave two opportunities to the BJP to rectify it.
 
 ""First during (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee's reign and now under Modi. It is not necessary to wait till 2019 to declare India a Hindu state. Modi can do it right now and we insist that he does it immediately,"" the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.
 
 The situation in India is not such that it should be called 'Hindu Pakistan'. There is a different kind of anarchy in Pakistan, the Sena said.
 
 ""The democratic system in that country (Pakistan) is over. Inflation, unemployment, corruption and other evils are wreaking havoc. Those speaking truth are being eliminated there. Pakistan has been like this since its birth,"" it added.
 
 ""But have the problems in India been resolved? They still persist. After demonetisation, the financial condition of the poor worsened. The government seeks to save cows and sheep, but cannot stop farmers' suicides,"" the Sena said.
 
 Though the government has not been able to build a Ram temple in  , the Railways has announced Ramayan Express to touch the sentiments of the people, it said.
 
 ""Till the 2019 elections, such colourful balloons will be released in the air and new promises will be made. This cannot be called a 'Ram rajya',"" the party said.

 The CBI has thrown the book at the MLA from Bangarmau and charged him for kidnapping, rape, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation and under Sections 3 and 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, along with Shashi. The woman aide allegedly lured the survivor to the house of the MLA on June 4 last year on the pretext of providing her a job, after which she was raped around 8pm while Shashi stood guard outside the room.
 
 The case grabbed national headlines after the survivor levelled the allegations and Sengar’s brother was arrested for an assault on the minor’s father, who later died in judicial custody. Police as well as doctors who examined the girl’s father after he was assaulted were hauled up for failing to refer him for medical attention and instead sending him to jail. The agency has relied on the statements of the survivor and her mother before additional sessions judge in Unnao in February this year. The role of police officials in Unnao is still under investigation and their names have not been included in the chargesheet as yet but it might be done at a future date.
 
 The CBI took due note of the girl’s statement, recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of CrPC, to which she “stood by” throughout the probe. Subsequently, the CBI found that the version given by the MLA in his defence didn’t match with corroborative evidence. Sengar’s claim that he was not in Unnao on the day of the crime didn’t match with records of his cellphone and other evidence. CBI sources said the MLA failed to provide a legally tenable alibi for himself for the day when the incident allegedly took place. 
  , a month after Sengar’s arrest, that CBI had corroborated the rape charge against the MLA and would file a chargesheet against him for raping the minor. The case had become politically contentious, with claims being made that MLA was not guilty of sex assault.
 
 CBI sources further confirmed that the survivor was again gang-raped by a different set of accused between June 11 and June 20, 2017. The investigation on this aspect of the case is continuing and the CBI will soon file a separate chargesheet against the other set of accused. While the rape survivor consistently named Sengar and other accused for raping her in her complaint to cops, UP police deliberately kept the MLA’s name out of the FIR. They also delayed her medical test and didn’t send vaginal swabs or her clothes to the forensic lab. The agency said that after her rape on June 4, the victim kept silent as she had been threatened. Faced with the embarrassment of the   being involved in the rape case, the state referred the matter to the CBI in April.

Following the order, Mahaakshay and his mother approached the Bombay High Court seeking pre-arrest bail or an interim relief from arrest till the time they approached the concerned court in the national capital.
 
 However, the court dismissed the pleas and refused to grant them any interim relief and said the duo could approach the court concerned in Delhi for pre-arrest bail.

In her complaint, she claimed that Bali had threatened her of dire consequences if she continued the relationship. The complainant also said she moved to Delhi from Mumbai as she feared for her life in view of threats made by Bali and her son.

"After sex scandals, column in church magazine paints bishop & priests as ‘victims’",2018-07-10T15:29:21+05:30,"IDUKKI: The ‘Indian Currents’ (IC), a weekly   owned by the   Church, has come out in open   of Jalandhar   Franco Mulakal and Orthodox   in the controversial sex scandals.

 
  The guest column of the latest issue of the IC, published from New Delhi under the patronage of the Capuchins of Krist Jyothi province of North India, questioned the   charge against the bishop and priests and noted that there were no repeated rapes.
 
  However, the irony is that the editorial and main story of the magazine pointed out that women safety is a big issue in India. A column, ‘Villains as victims: Why call sex, rape?’ by A J Philip, describes his cordial meetings with the bishop. The magazine also tries to whitewash the accused bishop and priests.
 
 “In the  , an adult person has to confess his/her sins to the priest at least once a year. The story of the woman in question is that she told the priest about her ‘sin’ and it encouraged him to ‘rape’ her. She kept on confessing and the priests kept on ‘raping’ her,” said the columnist. 
 
  “In Jalandhar issue, assuming that what she says is true, can a person who reached the status of Mother General in her religious order be ‘raped’ 13 times? Did she complain after the first, second, third, fourth and fifth rapes? Forget all of them, did she complain after the 13th rape?,” he asked.
 
  “Billions of men and women copulate every day for reasons I do not have to explain. This has been happening right from the days of Adam and Eve. But a modern-day Eve finds it convenient to claim that she was raped when she is caught in the act,” noted the columnist.
 
  The magazine points out that a global poll ranks India as the most dangerous country for women. Human trafficking, sexual violence, child marriage, genital mutation and acid attacks are the main issues, it says.
 
 “If found guilty, the bishop and priests should be punished. But the complaints of the nun and Orthodox girl were raising some doubts over the rape issue. I have expressed my doubts as part of the column. I have no need to whitewash anyone,” the columnist noted.
 
 “Rape, no doubt, is a heinous crime. I condemn in unequivocal terms rape of any one, be it a girl, married woman or a nun. But here, it appears to be an accusation by a disgruntled nun. Can a person who has reached the highest position in the congregation remain silent when she is violated 13 times? As a Mother General, she had trained her sisters to speak against violence and injustice. Why was she unable to raise her voice against the bishop from 2014-2018,” asked IC chief editor Fr Suresh Mathew.

 Following discussions with the home secretary, the department of justice in the law ministry has prepared a draft scheme for setting up of ""special fast track courts"" to try rape cases.
 
 On June 14, the department had informed the Cabinet Secretary that the draft is ready and awaiting approval of the law minister.
 
 The new scheme is part of an ordinance recently promulgated to allow courts to award the death penalty to those convicted of raping children aged up to 12 years.
 
 The Criminal Laws (Amendment) Ordinance amended the IPC, the CrPC, the Evidence Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
 
 While bringing out the ordinance, the government had decided to frame a scheme to set up an ""appropriate"" number of fast track courts to try rape cases in the states.
 
 The scheme will include components including strengthening of the physical infrastructure and prosecution machinery, provision of the required number of judicial officers for lower courts, additional posts of public prosecutors, dedicated investigators and special forensic kits.
 
 The proposal is expected to come up shortly before the Cabinet.
 
 In April, the government had issued an ordinance to provide stringent punishment, including death, for those convicted of raping minors up to the age of 12 years, amid a nationwide outrage over cases of sexual assault and the murder of minors in Kathua and Surat and the rape of a girl in Unnao.
 
 New fast-track courts will be set up to deal with such cases and special forensic kits for rape cases will be given to all police stations and hospitals in the long term, according to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance.
 
 It stipulates stringent punishment for perpetrators of rape, particularly of girls below 16 and 12 years. The death sentence has been provided for rapists of girls under 12 years.
 
 The minimum punishment in the case of the rape of women has been increased from a rigorous imprisonment of seven years to 10 years, extendable to life imprisonment.
 
 The measure also provides for speedy investigation and trial. The time limit for investigation of all cases of rape has been prescribed and has to be now completed within two months.
 
 The deadline for the completion of trial in all rape cases will be two months, officials said. A six-month time limit for the disposal of appeals in rape cases has also been prescribed.
 
 New posts of public prosecutors will be created and special forensic kits for rape cases given to all police stations and hospitals in the long term, the officials said.
 
 Dedicated manpower will be provided for investigation of rape cases in a time-bound manner.
 
 Special forensic labs exclusively for rape cases would also come up in each state.

Church sources said that the message has been passed on to the now-on-the-lam priests ""with a strong directive"" that they should not be wearing the cloak while surrendering. 

 
  ""If the priests appear in civil dress, it may not be easy to identify them. But their appearance in the religious attire will further embarrass the church,'' sources said. 
 
 Police have been probing the roles of four priests, Fr Johnson V Mathew, Fr Sony Varghese, Fr Job Mathew, and Fr Jaise K George in the case. The homemaker had in an affidavit to the church named them.
 
  All except Fr Johnson Mathew had moved the high court of   for anticipatory bail, which was rejected on Wednesday. The possibility of defrocking - stripping a priest of his ecclesiastical status - the four priests have been ruled out for the time being since the church has no provision for it. 
 
  ""Once ordained as priest, he will remain so throughout his life,"" said M O John, priest trustee of the Orthodox Church. ""The only restriction we can bring is to tell the person not to officiate as a priest or conduct any church-related function,'' he said . 
 
  In such a case, the role of the priest would be the same as that of a laity. P C Elias, public relations officer of the church said the priests have been suspended from performing church duties. He also said that the church has so far never contemplated the issue of defrocking them. 
 
  Biju Oommen, secretary of the Malankara Orthodox Church Association, said action would be taken against the four priests based on the Canonical rules after an internal church inquiry. 
 
  ""Till the probe by the church is completed the priests will be under suspension,"" he said. He added that the church would act if the priests were found to be guilty under the law of the land. He, however, hinted that the church would take action against the priests soon. ""The church's Synod and the managing committee meeting will be held in August. Necessary action will be taken by that time,"" he said.

 Justice A K Pathak issued a notice and sought the response of the complainant and the police on a plea filed by the BJP spokesperson who had challenged the decision of the trial court to direct lodging of a criminal case against him in the matter earlier.
 
 The high court, which was initially not inclined to stay the trial court order, later agreed to grant the relief after hearing arguments on behalf of Hussain’s counsel.
 
 “The operation of the trial court’s July 12 order to remain stayed till the next date of hearing i.e. December 6.” Justice Pathak directed and sought a response from the police. In her complaint, the Delhi-based woman alleged she was raped by Hussain and has also levelled other allegations. When the police refused to register the case, she had moved the trial court.
 
 A magistrate court had, on July 7, ordered registration of an FIR against Hussain, saying a cognizable offence was made out in the complaint of the woman. This was challenged by the BJP leader before a sessions court, which — after granting a brief stay — finally dismissed his plea.
 
 Consequently, Hussain moved HC seeking a stay on criminal proceedings and quashing of the sessions court’s order.
 
 Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for Hussain, argued that the order for lodging an FIR against the BJP leader had to be quashed as it was a case of complete absurdity. He also contended that there was a dispute between the woman and Hussain’s brother and that the BJP leader got dragged into it, adding that Hussain had also filed a complaint with Delhi Police earlier that he was receiving abusive content from the woman on social media.

 Senior superintendent of police, Gurdaspur, HS Bhullar told TOI that all the accused were brought to Gurdaspur on Wednesday evening. The police have made elaborate security arrangements in Gurdaspur jail, including a heavy security cordon around the prison.
 
 The accused were brought to Gurdaspur in a Jammu and Kashmir government vehicle at around 6 pm under tight security. They would be taken to the Pathankot court daily for the case hearings. “We have already made security arrangements for that,” Bhullar said.
 
 The trial court in Pathankot was hardly conducting proceedings for 2-3 hours a day as the accused needed to be transported to the court and back daily.
 
 A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra had on Monday allowed the plea of the victim’s family which wanted the accused to be shifted to Gurdaspur district jail as valuable time was lost in taking them from Kathua to Pathankot, which hampered trial proceedings.

It, however, directed the J&K government to make arrangements for family members of the accused, who would like to meet them in Gurdaspur.
 
 The bench granted eight weeks for filing of the supplementary chargesheet and also directed the Punjab government to provide security to the trial judge. It also asked the J&K govt to give security cover to the special public prosecutor in the case.

 Pankaj Sharma, counsel for the legal guardian of the girl (her mother in this case), said: “The honorable court, after hearing petition of the victim, directed chief medical officer (CMO) of the district to constitute a panel of three doctors to examine her and present a report before the court by July 11.”
 
 The court fixed July 11 as the next date of hearing in the case. The matter was heard by single bench of justice Manoj Tiwari. 
 
 According to petition, the alleged rape came to the fore in April. The girl was allegedly abducted and raped in March. When her parents went to doctors for termination of the pregnancy in June, they refused to do so citing government norms.
 
 According to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, termination of pregnancy cannot be conducted after 20 weeks.
 
 The Supreme Court is flooded with petitions from across the country seeking permission for termination of pregnancy. On July 25, 2016 the SC had allowed a rape survivor to terminate her 24-week-old “abnormal” foetus after a medical board certified that it would endanger her life. Over a dozen cases have reached the apex court since then. However, in several cases, the courts have denied permission to abort the foetus. In July last year, the apex court had rejected a 10-year-old rape survivor’s request to terminate her 32-week pregnancy. Medical opinion placed before the court said the abortion would not be in the interest of either the girl or the foetus.

The teenager, in her complaint to the police, had alleged that she was raped and blackmailed by her school principal, two teachers and 16 students for seven months.
 
 Police sources said an FIR had been registered in the case under Sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and the POCSO Act. In her complaint, the girl alleged that she was first raped by some of the students of her school in a toilet there in December 2017.
 
 “The entire ordeal started in December last when three boys raped her for first time and she tried to seek help from school principal but he also took advantage of the situation instead of helping the victim. The last incident of sexual assault with the girl happened six days ago,”   DGP K S Dwivedi told TOI on Saturday.
 
 “I had a telephonic conversation with Saran SP Har Kishore Rai on Friday as well as Saturday to take stock of the situation as the crime was of very serious nature,” Diwedi said, adding police were awaiting report of the girl’s medical examination.
 
 Saran SP Rai said when the girl complained to the school principal about the incident, he first convinced and persuaded her not to lodge a complaint as the matter would bring disrepute to her and the family and later along with two teachers raped and blackmailed her.
 
 The girl told reporters on Saturday that she could not muster courage to lodge a complaint with the police since her father was in jail for several months. Her father was released from jail a couple of days ago and a complaint was lodged on Friday, she said.
 
 The principal told the court that the allegations against him were false and this was a conspiracy to frame him in the case in order to bring disrepute to him and the school.

  Pavan Duggal, chairman of the International Commission of Cyber Security Law, too felt the ""high-profile stature"" of the complainant means this could be an example of ""customised justice"" and not ""generic justice"". ""The police invariably give step-motherly treatment to the common man whose issues are low priority to them,"" he said. 
 
 Duggal stressed on the need to adopt a ""holistic approach"" to deter anonymous trolls as a matter of ""de facto routine"". ""We need to come up with strong legal provisions to deal with trolls,"" he said.
 
 Such steps are becoming imperative given that a recent study by a global cybersecurity firm showed that eight out of 10 persons in India reported some form of online abuse. Another study by a Delhi NGO detailed how vocal women often have to deal with violent threats and  . After the arrest, Priyanka Chaturvedi herself pointed out that ""they like to target women who have a different opinion"" and stressed the need to send a strong message.
 
  ""Threatening the   of a child is the lowest thing. It's disgusting,"" said women's rights lawyer Flavia Agnes. Pointing out the vicious trolling of foreign minister Sushma Swaraj over her ministry's clearance to the passport of a Hindu-Muslim couple, Agnes said: ""This has been happening again and again and it is getting out of hand. Arresting is one thing but we need to put an end to this menace."" 
 
  The swift police action has impressed Mumbai cybercrime investigator Ritesh Bhatia. ""It is not too difficult to catch trolls using fake ID these days since   platforms are ready to provide the police with user logs that help track their IP address. I am glad Twitter responded quickly,"" said Bhatia. ""I also hope that such speedy action is taken for all those who are threatened and abused, irrespective of their profession, status and political affiliations.""

Villagers decide to ostracise rape accused’s family,2018-07-06T09:00:41+05:30,"JAIPUR: Residents of a village in Jaipur have decided to completely ostracise the family members of the 25-year old youth who is accused of raping a four-year-old girl. Angry villagers want the family to leave their locality and have threatened to cut off water and electricity supply to the accused’s house.

 
 The villagers said they feel threatened by the presence of the family and want them to pack their bags and leave the neighbourhood. In a meeting called on Thursday, the villagers wrote a letter to the local sarpanch to ensure that the accused’s family moves out of the locality. “We live in a society. Whatever has happened is unfortunate and we don’t want the family to live here,” said Vijay Kumar, a villager who took part in the meeting.
 
 
 
 
 The residents said that they also want that power and water connection should be disconnected with immediate effect.
 
 The incident was reported on late Monday night under the limits of Kanota police station area at the outskirts of Jaipur when the accused, who lived next to the child’s house, returned to his home heavily drunk and spotted the minor girl playing with her siblings. “He raped her and fled, we believe that a stringent punishment should be given to him,” Kumar said.
 
 The villagers said that about 50 residents had gathered on Thursday morning to decide the family’s fate. The angry villagers unanimously decided to boycott the accused’s family, and requested that nobody should interact with them.
 
 Madan Lal Gujjar, the local sarpanch said that villagers had come to him demanding the family be asked to leave. “This is a JDA land; we cannot take any decision on our own. Also, the villagers can contact electricity and water department officials about disconnecting connections to the family,” he said. A villager told TOI that the accused’s mother lives with her two sons in the house. “One of the sons had been recently involved in some crime too,” he said.

Gujarat man held for rape threat to Congress spokesperson's child,2018-07-06T09:27:11+05:30,"MUMBAI: Within 48 hours of home minister   asking for action after an unidentified troll threatened Congress spokesperson  's minor daughter with  , Girish Maheshwari, 36, was arrested near Ahmedabad on Thursday. 

 
  
  
 
 Maheshwari, originally from Rajasthan, works as an accountant in a food agro company and has been living in a bungalow at Bavla, a satellite town 30km from Ahmedabad. He also owns a grocery store which is run by his brother Nandu.
 
 Interestingly, Maheshwari's Facebook profile says he is a   worker. But no independent confirmation could be obtained from the BJP.
 
 After the home ministry prod on Tuesday, the Goregaon police filed a case against the troll under the stringent Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act, and sections of the I-T Act and the IPC. When the Goregaon police approached Twitter for details of the accused's account, @GirishK1605, they gave 35 dynamic IP addresses that the account had used. The home ministry had also requested Twitter to help find the troll.
 
  
 The police got in touch with Maheshwari's internet service provider and traced him to Bavla. He was picked up on Thursday, brought to Mumbai by road and produced in court, which sent him to police custody till July 10. This is perhaps the first time Pocso has been slappeed for online threats. 
 
 After the arrest, Chaturvedi said she hoped the police action would instil fear in the minds of those who think they can get away with making vile threats on social media. ""I have been informed by Mumbai police that the man has been remanded till July 10. They have assured me that a watertight case will be built. I can only say I will be able to sleep a lot more comfortably tonight knowing there is more security in place. Maybe we have instilled some fear in the minds of those who think they can get away with saying anything. I sleep with that hope,"" she told TOI.
 
 The sordid episode started after a fake quote on the recent gangrape of a minor in Mandsaur, supporting the accused and attributed to Chaturvedi, went viral. On Sunday, @GirishK1605 made a rape threat aimed at the 10-year-old daughter of the spokesperson. On Monday, she tweeted to Mumbai police for help, but a case wasn't filed. On Tuesday, once Singh intervened, FIRs were filed both in Mumbai and Delhi, and the probe sped along.
 
 After getting the dynamic IP addresses used by Maheshwari, the cops tracked him down. An IP address is a unique address used to identify computers on a network. A dynamic IP address is generally a temporary address typically assigned randomly or by a server. In many situations, the only information one can obtain from an IP address would be the Internet Service Provider (ISP) that the user is connected to and an approximate location of the ISP. To obtain the name and address of the user for an IP address would require the ISP to look up this information, which can only be done by law enforcement agencies. The Goregaon cops did that and nabbed the accused.
 
  
 The   thanked the police and home minister Rajnath Singh for taking an interest in the case. She, however, said she thought it was unfortunate that few NDA ministers threw their weight behind foreign minister  , when she was attacked recently.

Rejecting the plea, the judge held that since the issue was decided on the medical board’s opinion, there was no need for more verification. Sawhney said a petition against the trial court’s June 12 order for constitution of a medical board had already been filed in the Punjab and Haryana high court and the hearing was listed for July 10.
