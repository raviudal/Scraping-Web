  “It was after they stopped paying money and the child was not receiving proper medical attention, the victim’s family approached police,” she said.
 
  She said that the accused’s father died almost four years back and his mother collects honey from different area. The SHO said the accused was continually changing his location until he was caught from his maternal uncle’s house in Salimpur. “The minor girl’s parents are daily wagers,” Ranjana said.
 
  When asked, the SHO said that it was yet not clear that what instigated the boy to commit such a heinous crime.
 
  “Only after further investigation, it would surface that if he was in wrong circle or used to watch pornographic materials on cellphone,” she said.
 
  Ranjana said the accused is inconsistent in his statements. “He has confessed his crime but said that he doesn’t know how things happened. Several things including his mental condition needs to me medically examined to ensure if inconsistency in statement was due to his situation or he was misleading police,” SHO Ranjana said.

"Will Amit Shah apologise for UP BJP MLA's remark on rape, asks Sena",2018-07-13T14:12:16+05:30,"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Friday asked whether BJP president Amit Shah would apologise for his party's UP MLA's remark that even Lord Ram cannot curb rapes.

 ""Tharoor said if the BJP wins the 2019 (Lok Sabha) polls, India will become 'Hindu Pakistan'. In short, if (Narendra) Modi is voted to power again, India will be declared a Hindu rashtra (nation).
 
 ""This is RSS's agenda, which Tharoor has only expressed from the Congress platform,"" the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ' '.
 
 The Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram, Tharoor, had set off a political controversy on Wednesday with his remark that if voted to power again, the BJP will rewrite the Constitution and pave the way for creation of a ""Hindu Pakistan"".
 
 
 On Thursday, the BJP had demanded an apology from Gandhi for the ""attack on Indian democracy and Hindus"".
 
 ""The BJP wants Congress president Gandhi to apologise for Tharoor's remarks. But one needs to understand that Tharoor is only speaking the language of the BJP,"" the Sena said.
 
 ""One of its MLAs Surendra Narayan Singh had said even Lord Ram cannot curb rapes. His statement is an insult to Hindus. Shouldn't BJP chief Amit Shah apologise for his remark?"" it said.
 
 BJP MLA from Bairia in Uttar Pradesh, Singh, had recently said, ""Bhagwan Ram bhi aa jaayenge, tab bhi balaatkaar ki ghatna per niyantran nahi ho paayegaa (The incidents of rape cannot be curbed, even if Lord Ram descends on earth)"".

 The situation in India is not such that it should be called 'Hindu Pakistan'. There is a different kind of anarchy in Pakistan, the Sena said.
 
 ""The democratic system in that country (Pakistan) is over. Inflation, unemployment, corruption and other evils are wreaking havoc. Those speaking truth are being eliminated there. Pakistan has been like this since its birth,"" it added.
 
 ""But have the problems in India been resolved? They still persist. After demonetisation, the financial condition of the poor worsened. The government seeks to save cows and sheep, but cannot stop farmers' suicides,"" the Sena said.

 In November 1990, Norton Jones went on a date with Simmons. She recalls that they had a pleasant night out, which ended with the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings inviting her to see his new apartment in downtown  . 
 
  
  
 There, Jones said, Simmons pinned her against a wall and raped her. 
 
 ""It was such a fast attack. He pulled my dress up. I must have said no seven to 10 times,"" she told.
 
 After she left, distraught and in shock, Jones claims that Simmons continued to pursue her, calling her at home and approaching her at social events.

CBI charges BJP MLA Sengar and aide with rape of minor in Unnao,2018-07-12T05:55:26+05:30,"NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: Almost three months after taking over the investigation of the politically sensitive  , the   filed a chargesheet on Wednesday against BJP MLA   and his woman accomplice, Shashi Singh, for the alleged rape of a minor girl at his residence on June 4, 2017.

 
 The CBI has thrown the book at the MLA from Bangarmau and charged him for kidnapping, rape, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation and under Sections 3 and 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, along with Shashi. The woman aide allegedly lured the survivor to the house of the MLA on June 4 last year on the pretext of providing her a job, after which she was raped around 8pm while Shashi stood guard outside the room.
 
 The case grabbed national headlines after the survivor levelled the allegations and Sengar’s brother was arrested for an assault on the minor’s father, who later died in judicial custody. Police as well as doctors who examined the girl’s father after he was assaulted were hauled up for failing to refer him for medical attention and instead sending him to jail. The agency has relied on the statements of the survivor and her mother before additional sessions judge in Unnao in February this year. The role of police officials in Unnao is still under investigation and their names have not been included in the chargesheet as yet but it might be done at a future date.
 
 The CBI took due note of the girl’s statement, recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of CrPC, to which she “stood by” throughout the probe. Subsequently, the CBI found that the version given by the MLA in his defence didn’t match with corroborative evidence. Sengar’s claim that he was not in Unnao on the day of the crime didn’t match with records of his cellphone and other evidence. CBI sources said the MLA failed to provide a legally tenable alibi for himself for the day when the incident allegedly took place. 
  , a month after Sengar’s arrest, that CBI had corroborated the rape charge against the MLA and would file a chargesheet against him for raping the minor. The case had become politically contentious, with claims being made that MLA was not guilty of sex assault.
 
 CBI sources further confirmed that the survivor was again gang-raped by a different set of accused between June 11 and June 20, 2017. The investigation on this aspect of the case is continuing and the CBI will soon file a separate chargesheet against the other set of accused. While the rape survivor consistently named Sengar and other accused for raping her in her complaint to cops, UP police deliberately kept the MLA’s name out of the FIR. They also delayed her medical test and didn’t send vaginal swabs or her clothes to the forensic lab. The agency said that after her rape on June 4, the victim kept silent as she had been threatened. Faced with the embarrassment of the   being involved in the rape case, the state referred the matter to the CBI in April.

 The court asked the Centre to indicate its stand on the issue and listed it for further hearing on October 22.
 
 Section 375 of the IPC deals with rape committed by a man and section 376 lists out the punishment for the said offence.
 
 According to petitioner Sanjjiiv KKumaar, a social activist, both sections 375 and 376 in their current form are gender-specific and does not secure males, especially adults.
 
 He said in his plea that boys under the age of 18 are protected under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), but once they pass the age, they ""are robbed of their rights"".
 
 The plea also said that according to the Supreme Court ruling on the Right to Privacy, both male and female have equal protection of the law under the Constitution.
 
 Kkumaar claimed in his petition that for a brief period of 58 days, India had a gender-neutral rape law - The Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance 2013 which was repealed after protests from certain quarters of the society.

 Justice A K Pathak issued a notice and sought the response of the complainant and the police on a plea filed by the BJP spokesperson who had challenged the decision of the trial court to direct lodging of a criminal case against him in the matter earlier.
 
 The high court, which was initially not inclined to stay the trial court order, later agreed to grant the relief after hearing arguments on behalf of Hussain’s counsel.
 
 “The operation of the trial court’s July 12 order to remain stayed till the next date of hearing i.e. December 6.” Justice Pathak directed and sought a response from the police. In her complaint, the Delhi-based woman alleged she was raped by Hussain and has also levelled other allegations. When the police refused to register the case, she had moved the trial court.
 
 A magistrate court had, on July 7, ordered registration of an FIR against Hussain, saying a cognizable offence was made out in the complaint of the woman. This was challenged by the BJP leader before a sessions court, which — after granting a brief stay — finally dismissed his plea.
 
 Consequently, Hussain moved HC seeking a stay on criminal proceedings and quashing of the sessions court’s order.
 
 Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for Hussain, argued that the order for lodging an FIR against the BJP leader had to be quashed as it was a case of complete absurdity. He also contended that there was a dispute between the woman and Hussain’s brother and that the BJP leader got dragged into it, adding that Hussain had also filed a complaint with Delhi Police earlier that he was receiving abusive content from the woman on social media.

Kathua gang rape-murder accused shifted to Gurdaspur on SC order,2018-07-13T01:07:21+05:30,"Gurdaspur: All accused in the Kathua gang rape-cum-murder case were shifted to Punjab’s Gurdaspur jail on Wednesday from Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir. The Supreme Court had on Monday directed that all the eight accused should be shifted to Gurdaspur on a plea filed by the eight-year-old victim’s family.

 Senior superintendent of police, Gurdaspur, HS Bhullar told TOI that all the accused were brought to Gurdaspur on Wednesday evening. The police have made elaborate security arrangements in Gurdaspur jail, including a heavy security cordon around the prison.
 
 The accused were brought to Gurdaspur in a Jammu and Kashmir government vehicle at around 6 pm under tight security. They would be taken to the Pathankot court daily for the case hearings. “We have already made security arrangements for that,” Bhullar said.
 
 The trial court in Pathankot was hardly conducting proceedings for 2-3 hours a day as the accused needed to be transported to the court and back daily.
 
 A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra had on Monday allowed the plea of the victim’s family which wanted the accused to be shifted to Gurdaspur district jail as valuable time was lost in taking them from Kathua to Pathankot, which hampered trial proceedings. The bench, after a brief hearing, directed shifting of the accused to Gurdaspur saying it was necessary in view of exceptional circumstances of the case. It, however, directed the J&K government to make arrangements for family members of the accused, who would like to meet them in Gurdaspur.
 
 The bench granted eight weeks for filing of the supplementary chargesheet and also directed the Punjab government to provide security to the trial judge. It also asked the J&K govt to give security cover to the special public prosecutor in the case.
 
 The SC also directed the trial court not to allow outsiders to enter the court room during the proceedings.

Under Khandu's leadership, the state has become a 'Balatkari Pradesh'. Ever since the BJP government took charge, anti-social elements have increased and there has been a growth in the number of rape cases, mob lynching and gun culture. This indicates that the present government is shielding culprits and rejoicing over the misery of people.""

However, crimes against minor girls and women are on the rise and the state government has maintained a stoic silence about the issue.

"After sex scandals, column in church magazine paints bishop & priests as ‘victims’",2018-07-10T15:29:21+05:30,"IDUKKI: The ‘Indian Currents’ (IC), a weekly   owned by the   Church, has come out in open   of Jalandhar   Franco Mulakal and Orthodox   in the controversial sex scandals.

 
  The guest column of the latest issue of the IC, published from New Delhi under the patronage of the Capuchins of Krist Jyothi province of North India, questioned the   charge against the bishop and priests and noted that there were no repeated rapes.
 
  However, the irony is that the editorial and main story of the magazine pointed out that women safety is a big issue in India. A column, ‘Villains as victims: Why call sex, rape?’ by A J Philip, describes his cordial meetings with the bishop. The magazine also tries to whitewash the accused bishop and priests.
 
 “In the  , an adult person has to confess his/her sins to the priest at least once a year. The story of the woman in question is that she told the priest about her ‘sin’ and it encouraged him to ‘rape’ her. She kept on confessing and the priests kept on ‘raping’ her,” said the columnist. 
 
  “In Jalandhar issue, assuming that what she says is true, can a person who reached the status of Mother General in her religious order be ‘raped’ 13 times? Did she complain after the first, second, third, fourth and fifth rapes? Forget all of them, did she complain after the 13th rape?,” he asked.
 
  “Billions of men and women copulate every day for reasons I do not have to explain. This has been happening right from the days of Adam and Eve. But a modern-day Eve finds it convenient to claim that she was raped when she is caught in the act,” noted the columnist.
 
  The magazine points out that a global poll ranks India as the most dangerous country for women. Human trafficking, sexual violence, child marriage, genital mutation and acid attacks are the main issues, it says.
 
 “If found guilty, the bishop and priests should be punished. But the complaints of the nun and Orthodox girl were raising some doubts over the rape issue. I have expressed my doubts as part of the column. I have no need to whitewash anyone,” the columnist noted.
 
 “Rape, no doubt, is a heinous crime. I condemn in unequivocal terms rape of any one, be it a girl, married woman or a nun. But here, it appears to be an accusation by a disgruntled nun. Can a person who has reached the highest position in the congregation remain silent when she is violated 13 times? As a Mother General, she had trained her sisters to speak against violence and injustice. Why was she unable to raise her voice against the bishop from 2014-2018,” asked IC chief editor Fr Suresh Mathew.

Rape survivor seeks Uttarakhand HC's permission to terminate pregnancy,2018-07-07T15:32:51+05:30,"NAINITAL: A 16-year-old rape survivor approached   on Friday seeking its permission to terminate her five-month-old pregnancy caused by the sexual assault. The girl, a resident of   town in Nainital district, moved the court through her mother.

 
 Pankaj Sharma, counsel for the legal guardian of the girl (her mother in this case), said: “The honorable court, after hearing petition of the victim, directed chief medical officer (CMO) of the district to constitute a panel of three doctors to examine her and present a report before the court by July 11.”
 
 The court fixed July 11 as the next date of hearing in the case. The matter was heard by single bench of justice Manoj Tiwari. 
 
 According to petition, the alleged rape came to the fore in April. The girl was allegedly abducted and raped in March. When her parents went to doctors for termination of the pregnancy in June, they refused to do so citing government norms.
 
 According to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, termination of pregnancy cannot be conducted after 20 weeks.
 
 The Supreme Court is flooded with petitions from across the country seeking permission for termination of pregnancy. On July 25, 2016 the SC had allowed a rape survivor to terminate her 24-week-old “abnormal” foetus after a medical board certified that it would endanger her life. Over a dozen cases have reached the apex court since then. However, in several cases, the courts have denied permission to abort the foetus. In July last year, the apex court had rejected a 10-year-old rape survivor’s request to terminate her 32-week pregnancy. Medical opinion placed before the court said the abortion would not be in the interest of either the girl or the foetus.

 The fourth accused, Akshay Thakur, has not filed a review petition yet.
 
 The convicts' counsel pleaded that the police had implicated the ""innocent"" persons after failing to arrest the real culprits.
 
 It was contended that the death penalty was not the solution as it was against the principle of non-violence. Further, the convicts were not habitual offenders with a criminal history.

Law ministry ready with draft to set up special fast track courts to try rape cases,2018-07-10T17:07:51+05:30,"NEW DELHI: The law ministry has come up with a proposal to set up ""special"" fast track courts across India to try rape cases as part of a larger scheme to strengthen the infrastructure for better investigation and   prosecution in such cases.

 
 Following discussions with the home secretary, the department of justice in the law ministry has prepared a draft scheme for setting up of ""special fast track courts"" to try rape cases.
 
 On June 14, the department had informed the Cabinet Secretary that the draft is ready and awaiting approval of the law minister.
 
 The new scheme is part of an ordinance recently promulgated to allow courts to award the death penalty to those convicted of raping children aged up to 12 years.
 
 The Criminal Laws (Amendment) Ordinance amended the IPC, the CrPC, the Evidence Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
 
 While bringing out the ordinance, the government had decided to frame a scheme to set up an ""appropriate"" number of fast track courts to try rape cases in the states.
 
 The scheme will include components including strengthening of the physical infrastructure and prosecution machinery, provision of the required number of judicial officers for lower courts, additional posts of public prosecutors, dedicated investigators and special forensic kits.
 
 The proposal is expected to come up shortly before the Cabinet.
 
 In April, the government had issued an ordinance to provide stringent punishment, including death, for those convicted of raping minors up to the age of 12 years, amid a nationwide outrage over cases of sexual assault and the murder of minors in Kathua and Surat and the rape of a girl in Unnao.
 
 New fast-track courts will be set up to deal with such cases and special forensic kits for rape cases will be given to all police stations and hospitals in the long term, according to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance.
 
 It stipulates stringent punishment for perpetrators of rape, particularly of girls below 16 and 12 years. The death sentence has been provided for rapists of girls under 12 years.
 
 The minimum punishment in the case of the rape of women has been increased from a rigorous imprisonment of seven years to 10 years, extendable to life imprisonment.
 
 The measure also provides for speedy investigation and trial. The time limit for investigation of all cases of rape has been prescribed and has to be now completed within two months.
 
 The deadline for the completion of trial in all rape cases will be two months, officials said. A six-month time limit for the disposal of appeals in rape cases has also been prescribed.
 
 New posts of public prosecutors will be created and special forensic kits for rape cases given to all police stations and hospitals in the long term, the officials said.
 
 Dedicated manpower will be provided for investigation of rape cases in a time-bound manner.
 
 Special forensic labs exclusively for rape cases would also come up in each state.

He also demanded a reinvestigation in the case, saying, “Some rich people involved in the crime are still untraceable and the CBI is shielding them.” 

 Speaking to media persons on the sidelines of the release of book titled ‘Gudiya - Unsuni Cheekh’, he urged Prime Minister   to intervene and order a fresh probe into the shocking crime. The 115-page book is a collection of poems and stories, brought out by the Madad Seva Trust of Shimla. 
 
 Pointing out that the CBI has so far arrested one person in the case, he said, “How is it possible that a single person is involved in such a heinous crime.” He claimed the crime was not committed at the place where the body was found as it was completely clean and had no mud marks on it. He also questioned the custodial killing of Suraj Singh, asking whether he was killed because he knew the truth.
 
 He said neither police nor CBI slueths have been able to explain where the body was kept for two days. He said the woodcutter arrested in the case could be involved in disposing off the body but doubted that he had raped her. “Where are the lost socks and two hair clips of my daughter?... Criminals did not even leave a shred of cloth on her body.” He alleged the matter was hushed up just because he is a poor man. “Had she been the daughter of some MLA, the investigation scenario would have been completely different,” he claimed.
 
 He alleged that money was used to hush up the case when police was conducting investigation in the case. “Re-investigation should be done to put the real accused behind the bars,” he said. “I have lost my daughter. Those involved in the crime should be hanged.”
 
 “We were hoping that CBI would arrest the real accused. While police arrested six people, including those from Nepal and  , of whom many have been released, CBI has arrested a wood cutter. CBI should be given more time (on the case) to bring out the truth,” he said.
 
 Last year, the body of a minor school girl, who was studying in Class X and had gone missing on July 4 while returning home from school, was found on July 6.

'Hope for such swift crackdowns for everyone',2018-07-06T03:11:40+05:30,"The prompt arrest has impressed cybercrime experts, but some are sceptical whether this case will serve as a deterrent for trolls or spell hope for citizens at the receiving end of online abuse. 

 
 ""I don't think this serves as sufficient deterrent for the everyday user. The victim here was a high-profile individual and action was taken after specific instructions from the Union home ministry towards both the police and Twitter,"" said Pranav MB of the Centre for Internet and Society, a non-profit whose focus areas include digital privacy and cybersecurity.
 
  Pavan Duggal, chairman of the International Commission of Cyber Security Law, too felt the ""high-profile stature"" of the complainant means this could be an example of ""customised justice"" and not ""generic justice"". ""The police invariably give step-motherly treatment to the common man whose issues are low priority to them,"" he said. 
 
 Duggal stressed on the need to adopt a ""holistic approach"" to deter anonymous trolls as a matter of ""de facto routine"". ""We need to come up with strong legal provisions to deal with trolls,"" he said.
 
 Such steps are becoming imperative given that a recent study by a global cybersecurity firm showed that eight out of 10 persons in India reported some form of online abuse. Another study by a Delhi NGO detailed how vocal women often have to deal with violent threats and  . After the arrest, Priyanka Chaturvedi herself pointed out that ""they like to target women who have a different opinion"" and stressed the need to send a strong message.
 
  ""Threatening the   of a child is the lowest thing. It's disgusting,"" said women's rights lawyer Flavia Agnes. Pointing out the vicious trolling of foreign minister Sushma Swaraj over her ministry's clearance to the passport of a Hindu-Muslim couple, Agnes said: ""This has been happening again and again and it is getting out of hand. Arresting is one thing but we need to put an end to this menace."" 
 
  The swift police action has impressed Mumbai cybercrime investigator Ritesh Bhatia. ""It is not too difficult to catch trolls using fake ID these days since   platforms are ready to provide the police with user logs that help track their IP address. I am glad Twitter responded quickly,"" said Bhatia. ""I also hope that such speedy action is taken for all those who are threatened and abused, irrespective of their profession, status and political affiliations.""

 Singh added that while he was trying to arrange the funds, to his ""shock"" he was produced before court on May 17 and told he had another case pending against him at Bandra railway police station.

Gujarat man held for rape threat to Congress spokesperson's child,2018-07-06T09:27:11+05:30,"MUMBAI: Within 48 hours of home minister   asking for action after an unidentified troll threatened Congress spokesperson  's minor daughter with  , Girish Maheshwari, 36, was arrested near Ahmedabad on Thursday. 

 
  
  
 
 Maheshwari, originally from Rajasthan, works as an accountant in a food agro company and has been living in a bungalow at Bavla, a satellite town 30km from Ahmedabad. He also owns a grocery store which is run by his brother Nandu.
 
 Interestingly, Maheshwari's Facebook profile says he is a   worker. But no independent confirmation could be obtained from the BJP.
 
 After the home ministry prod on Tuesday, the Goregaon police filed a case against the troll under the stringent Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act, and sections of the I-T Act and the IPC. When the Goregaon police approached Twitter for details of the accused's account, @GirishK1605, they gave 35 dynamic IP addresses that the account had used. The home ministry had also requested Twitter to help find the troll.
 
  
 The police got in touch with Maheshwari's internet service provider and traced him to Bavla. He was picked up on Thursday, brought to Mumbai by road and produced in court, which sent him to police custody till July 10. This is perhaps the first time Pocso has been slappeed for online threats. 
 
 After the arrest, Chaturvedi said she hoped the police action would instil fear in the minds of those who think they can get away with making vile threats on social media. ""I have been informed by Mumbai police that the man has been remanded till July 10. They have assured me that a watertight case will be built. I can only say I will be able to sleep a lot more comfortably tonight knowing there is more security in place. Maybe we have instilled some fear in the minds of those who think they can get away with saying anything. I sleep with that hope,"" she told TOI.
 
 The sordid episode started after a fake quote on the recent gangrape of a minor in Mandsaur, supporting the accused and attributed to Chaturvedi, went viral. On Sunday, @GirishK1605 made a rape threat aimed at the 10-year-old daughter of the spokesperson. On Monday, she tweeted to Mumbai police for help, but a case wasn't filed. On Tuesday, once Singh intervened, FIRs were filed both in Mumbai and Delhi, and the probe sped along.
 
 After getting the dynamic IP addresses used by Maheshwari, the cops tracked him down. An IP address is a unique address used to identify computers on a network. A dynamic IP address is generally a temporary address typically assigned randomly or by a server. In many situations, the only information one can obtain from an IP address would be the Internet Service Provider (ISP) that the user is connected to and an approximate location of the ISP. To obtain the name and address of the user for an IP address would require the ISP to look up this information, which can only be done by law enforcement agencies. The Goregaon cops did that and nabbed the accused.
 
  
 The   thanked the police and home minister Rajnath Singh for taking an interest in the case. She, however, said she thought it was unfortunate that few NDA ministers threw their weight behind foreign minister  , when she was attacked recently.

 A division bench of Chief Justice Vineet Saran and Justice B R Sarangi directed the crime branch officers to appear in court and apprise it about the progress made so far in the investigation into the case.
 
 The court's direction came in response to a number of petitions that sought an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the alleged gang-rape of a minor girl by security forces in October last year in Kunduli of Koraput  . What followed were rounds of aspersions cast on the veracity of the girl's allegations. The girl subsequently committed suicide on January 22 this year. 
 
 Four petitions have been filed in the high court seeking CBI probes or investigation by an independent agency into the   and suicide of the minor girl. The petitioners have all alleged that the state crime branch and police cannot conduct a fair probe into the incident. 
 
 Hearing the petitions, one of which was filed by the brother of the deceased, the high court had asked the state government to file a complete status report on the incident. ""The state government's counsel on Tuesday provided answers to the court that were factually incorrect. Annoyed and dissatisfied with the replies of the government, the court directed the investigating officer and the SP of the crime branch to appear before it,"" said senior advocate Narender Hooda, who is representing the deceased's brother in the case.
 
 Hooda further stated that during the hearing of the case, the government's counsel pointed out that the inquiry commission formed by the state government to probe the incident has issued notices to the petitioners of the case to appear before it and air their grievances. 
 
 ""They argued that none of them deposed before the commission. However, when the court asked to show the notices, the government counsel failed to give a proper reply. The court was irked about it,"" said Hooda.

 ‘I was too young to know how to protest, how to make my parents understand that I was being raped, again and again.
 
 In villages, everyone knows everyone else, in fact most of us are related. My rapist was a distant cousin. He was in college; I wasn’t even 10 years old. I called him ‘bhaiya’ (brother), yet he raped me each time I went to his house in our village in  .
 
 My mother would send me to his house to buy milk. That’s when he’d   me. At that age, I couldn’t understand what was happening but I knew it was not right.
 
 I would protest when my mother asked me to get milk, but couldn’t muster the courage to tell her what was happening to me. Every time I refused to go she asked me why. Finally, she started going to get the milk herself.
 
 
 The abuse stopped when we moved to the city. A few years later, that cousin came visiting. He was married. I turned and ran to my room, and refused to come out. My parents scolded me for behaving badly. My heart yearned to tell them but courage failed me again. I was around 12 at that time. I never saw him again.
 
 Last year, after I joined college, I heard about a voluntary organisation that encouraged people to break their silence around sexual abuse and harassment. I joined the group. Just being part of the group has made me realise that there are more people who have been sexually assaulted than I ever imagined.
 
  
  
 
 In the group, I gained the confidence to speak, and with that came the conviction to question all that was wrong around me. Now, if I see someone staring, pushing or trying to grope someone, I shout to him to stop. The sad part is that others don’t come forward to help or support. They just watch; this needs to change. Only if we rise collectively, can we hope to instill fear in the hearts and minds of those who sexually harass women.
 
 We need to have these conversations not only to heal ourselves but also warn others of the dangers they face, and the action to take in such circumstances.
 
 My parents are still unaware of what I’ve faced. I know the consequences of having this conversation but I want to share my real name soon. A beginning has to be made.

 Chaturvedi thanked the police for their swift action.

 Maheshwari, who was arrested in Ahmedabad, was taken to Mumbai today. And tomorrow, he will be produced in court.
 
 Chaturvedi, a Congress spokeswoman, complained to the Mumbai Police on Monday after a tweet from Maheshwari with the threat that he will rape her daughter. His reasoning - if that's what it can be called - was that he believed, wrongly, that Chaturvedi was supporting the man accused of rape in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh recently.
 
 The Congress spokeswoman mentioned in her complaint that the then unidentified Twitter troll, despite using an image of Lord Ram in his profile picture on Twitter, made such a vile threat.

  The 22-year-old girl’s father held a press conference during which she alleged that Bhatt was favouring the accused. She demanded a probe by an independent agency. “J K Bhatt asked me questions that must never be put to rape victims,” she said. “He told me that inserting wood in private parts cannot be termed rape. Because of such questions, rape survivors commit suicide rather than go to the police. Even I thought of committing suicide at one stage.” The girl says she was confined and raped in Satellite and Ghodasar areas of the city.
 
 In the photograph which went viral, minister Jadeja is seen receiving a bouquet from Mahavir Dalmiya, the father of one of the accused, Gaurav. “Many people had come to greet me when I became the minister. It is possible he visited me at that time,” Jadeja said. “Somebody told me that the meeting could have occurred during the   mass marriage ceremony. At any rate, he is definitely not in my circle. I have directed the police to take strict action against anyone found guilty.” 
 
 Jadeja issued a statement on Sunday, three days after the rape complaint was filed. “The   case is very sad and sensitive incident in which stern action will be taken without any favours,” he had stated.
 
 In the press conference, the girl alleged that Bhatt had asked her why she had gone to Nehrunagar on the day the crime was committed. “He even raised his voice on multiple occasions and tried to force me to change the rape FIR into a cheating complaint,” she said. “Bhatt told me that I had conspired to file the rape complaint because I had broken up with one of the accused. He even said that had he been in my position, he would have done the same.” The girl said the probe should be headed by a woman police official.
 
 In response to the allegations against Bhatt, city police commissioner A K Singh held a press conference on Sunday evening, and said that while the allegations were a blot on the city police, he had full faith in his team.“While we will investigate the allegations, our primary duty is to bring out the truth,” Singh said. “There are a lot of contradictions in the material evidence gathered by us, and in the details mentioned in the FIR.” Evidence comprises CCTV footage, call records, location and mobile forensics.
 
 Singh said that he does not want to send the case for trial with contradictory evidence and wants to strengthen the case by seeking clarifications from the victim. “Our team will win the trust of the victim once again and proceed in the correct direction,” he said. “I would prefer slow progress in the probe rather than going wrong. An FIR is the beginning of the probe and not the end of it.”

 Advocate A K Sawhney, who has filed the complaint on behalf of the accused, said that the accused who is a juvenile was tortured by the Jammu crime branch—first on June 22, when he was taken to Jammu for ossification test and secondly on June 23.
 
 “On June 23, he was illegally picked up from Kathua jail, taken into a private SUV car of a woman DSP rank officer and taken to crime branch office in Jammu. Since the accused was in judicial custody, police could not have moved him from jail without permission of the trial court. He was forced to depose against other accused.

Asaram had been sentenced to life imprisonment on April 25 for sexual exploitation of a minor girl at his gurukul near Jodhpur.

 
 In the same matter, the high court admitted similar petitions by two co-accused Sanchita Gupta alias Shilpi and Sharad Chandra and called for the case’s records from the trial court on Monday.
 
 According to the petitioners’ counsel Nishant Bora, the trio will soon be filing bail applications in the court.
 
 “We challenged the sentence of Asaram in high court today, while the sentences of two other co-accused had already been challenged. The high court has called for the records of case from the trial court,” Bora said.
 
 A sentence can be challenged within two months of its pronouncement but on account of lawyers’ month-long protest in Jodhpur, Asaram’s appeal could not be filed. Jodhpur lawyers had boycotted judicial work in protest against the demand by Udaipur lawyers for establishing HC’s circuit bench in Udaipur. According to sources, Asaram has taken utmost precaution in preparing the appeal’s draft as his bail applications before the conviction were all turned down from the trial court to the Supreme Court. The appeal draft is said to have been prepared by different noted advocates and was finalized by an advocate from the Supreme Court before filing it in the high court on Monday.
 
 Despite roping in noted advocates from across the nation, Asaram’s bail applications before the conviction were rejected 12 times between the trial court and the Supreme Court. Now after filing an appeal before the high court, the application for bail will be moved.
 
 On the other hand, the acquittal of two other co-accused Shiva and Prakash in the same rape case has been challenged by the rape survivor’s lawyer.

 The team investigating a conflict in the Kasai region of Democratic Republic of Congo told the UN Human Rights Council last week that they suspected all sides were guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
 
 Their detailed 126-page report catalogued gruesome attacks committed in the conflict, which erupted in late 2016, involving the Kamuina Nsapu and Bana Mura militias and Congo's armed forces, the FARDC.
 
 The testimony included boys being forced to rape their mothers, little girls being told witchcraft would allow them to catch bullets, and women forced to choose gang-rape or death.
 
 ""What happened in the Kasai simply beggars description,"" Congo's Human Rights Minister Marie-Ange Mushobekwa told the Council.
 
 ""One victim told us that in May 2017 she saw a group of Kamuina Nsapu militia, some of whom sported female genitals (clitorises and vaginas) as medals,"" the report said.
 
 ""Some witnesses recalled seeing people cutting up, cooking and eating human flesh, including penises cut from men who were still alive and from corpses, especially FARDC, and drinking human blood.""
 
 Lead investigator Bacre Waly Ndiaye told the Council that in one incident, at least 186 men and boys from a single village were beheaded by Kamuina Nsapu, many of whose members were children forced to fight, unarmed or wielding sticks, and were convinced that magic had made them invulnerable.
 
 Many such child soldiers were killed when FARDC soldiers machine-gunned them indiscriminately, he said.
 
 ""The bodies were often buried in mass graves... or were sometimes piled in trucks by soldiers to be buried elsewhere.""
 
 There were initially thought to be about 86 mass graves, but after investigating on the ground the team suspected there may be hundreds, he said.
 
 A Congolese government spokesman told Reuters that such information should be passed to magistrates in Congo.
 
 ""We were not aware of this and it is very curious. But it is clearly a politically motivated press campaign that has nothing to do with justice,"" he said.
 
 Mushobekwa said the government had given the expert team its whole-hearted cooperation and wanted the truth to come out, but she said some of the findings were ""rather doubtful"" because the investigation had been done quickly.
 
 ""One thing is absolutely certain. Each element of law enforcement and security forces that is responsible for these crimes will answer for their actions and will be severely punished,"" she said.

Pocso case filed against troll threatening rape,2018-07-04T02:17:50+05:30,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Taking a serious note of the threat received by the spokesperson of a national party through Twitter, the home ministry asked police in Mumbai and Delhi on Tuesday to register a criminal case, identify those behind the threat and initiate legal action.

 
 Home minister   spoke to Delhi Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik, and while directing him to file a separate FIR in the case, underlined that such threats on social media should be taken “very seriously”.
 
 With the ministry cracking the whip, the Mumbai police registered an FIR against an unknown troll for issuing rape threats to the spokesperson’s minor daughter. The case has been registered under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, and provisions of the IT Act and IPC. An FIR has also been lodged at the Tughlaq Road police station in Delhi. The home ministry also asked Twitter to furnish details of the account from which the threats were issued.
 
 The spokesperson shared the threatening tweet on Monday, posted from a handle named @GirishK1605. The tweet, which sparked outrage on social media, is no longer available.
 
 The spokesperson, who is in Delhi most of the time, thought Mumbai police would lodge a complaint on the basis of her tweet but was told to be physically present for that to happen. Later, she received a call from Delhi Police, and she asked them to file an FIR on the basis of her written complaint. Mumbai police swung into action later. 
 
 A lawyer, however, pointed out that the law says a person cannot be punished twice for the same offence. So, two police stations should not file separate FIRs. The spokesperson alleged the “disgusting comments” were part of harassment she was subjected to on social media after a fake quote on the recent gang-rape of a 7-year-old in   (MP) was attributed to her.

 Top police sources said that the 22-year-old rape survivor was in love with the prime accused, Gaurav Dalmiya, a 22-year-old computer engineer residing in Ghodasar.
 Their intense love, which developed into a physical relationship as well, slammed into a hurdle when Gaurav’s father Mahavir, who runs a factory in Vatva, rejected any prospect of marriage citing caste and cultural considerations.
  
  “Mahavir threatened to commit suicide if Gaurav did not sever ties with the survivor,” a senior police official said. “Gaurav dutifully cut all ties with the girl.”
  
  
  But sources said that Gaurav’s attempt to marry the girl had followed a thwarted bid to marry another lover. In fact, the sources said that cracks had begun appearing in Gaurav’s relationship with the girl in December 2017 over the other affair. That was the time when Gaurav had reunited with Yamini Nair, the co-accused in this case, along with Vrushabh Maru. All three are childhood friends and studied together in a school in Isanpur.
  
 Sources said that during this period Gaurav and Yamini fell in love, prompting Gaurav to propose marriage to her. “The match however was rejected by Yamini’s mother as she was against inter-caste marriage,” a source close to the Nair family said.
 
 When the girl, who was possessive about Gaurav came to know of his growing proximity to Yamini, she pressured him to marry her. That was the time when Gaurav went to his father seeking permission to marry the girl. 
 
 As conflicts raged in the love triangle, betrayal was looming for the girl. Vrushabh was allegedly taking advantage of the girl’s intimate video clips. According to the complaint, Vrushabh sent   messages to the girl blackmailing her .

New Swedish law recognises sex without consent as rape,2018-07-01T16:00:19+05:30,"STOCKHOLM: A tough new law that will recognise sex without explicit consent as rape comes into effect in Sweden on Sunday, after the country was rocked by the #MeToo movement denouncing sexual harassment and assault.

 The law stipulates that a person has committed rape if they have been part of a sexual act in which the other person has not participated ""freely"".
 
 Rape had previously been defined as a sexual act carried out with the use of violence or threat.
 
 Now for someone to face rape charges, ""it is no longer necessary that violence or threats were applied, or that the aggressor took advantage of the victim's particularly vulnerable situation,"" according to the government.
 
 Courts will need to pay particular attention to whether consent was expressed with words, gestures or in another manner, and judges will have to rule on the issue, according to the law passed in May.
 
 Judge Anna Hannell, who helped create the law, said there was ""absolutely no requirement to formally say 'yes', to hit a button in an app or anything else of the same type"".
 
 ""Simply participating physically is a sign of consent,"" she told Swedish news agency TT.
 
 More than 7,000 rapes were reported in Sweden last year, a 10 percent increase compared to 2016, latest official figures show.
 
 Rape is punishable by up to six years in prison, with a maximum penalty of 10 years if the victim is a minor.
 
 Backed by the ruling Social Democrat-Green coalition, the law has drawn criticism from several quarters including the Swedish lawyers' association and the national law council.
 
 Opponents say it will force judges to make arbitrary decisions on whether or not there was consent.
 
 However, the government has defended the legislation.
 
 ""#MeToo showed with force that a lot still needs to be done to fight sexual harassment and sexual violence at work and in the rest of society,"" Gender Equality Minister Lena Hallengren said in a statement on Sunday.
 
 The government will allocate 120 million krona (11.5 million euros/$13.5 million) to combat sexual abuse, she added.
 
 The #MeToo campaign exposing sexual misconduct, which began with the series of allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, has shaken up nearly every sector in Sweden, one of the most gender-equal countries in the world.
 
 More than 10,000 women in Sweden -- including actresses, journalists, lawyers, musicians, doctors and construction workers -- have spoken up and campaigned against harassment.
 
 ""#MeToo is changing behaviours and people now understand the extent to which sexual violence is widespread,"" said Ida Ostensson of the Make Equal foundation, a key campaigner for the new law.
 
 ""We finally have legislation that protects physical and sexual integrity,"" she added.
 
 In May, the Swedish Academy announced there would be no Nobel Literature Prize this year following a major sexual assault scandal.
 
 The announcement came after Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter in November published the testimonies of 18 women claiming to have been raped, sexually assaulted or harassed by Jean-Claude Arnault, an influential culture figure with long-standing ties to the Academy. He has since been charged with two counts of rape.
 
 The scandal sowed deep discord among the institution's 18 members, prompting six to resign.
 
 ""It's important that society clearly states what is OK and what isn't,"" Erik Moberg, a Swede in his thirties, told AFP.
 
 ""It makes you think about your own behaviour and that of others.""

New Swedish law recognises sex without consent as rape,2018-07-01T20:25:44+05:30,"STOCKHOLM: A tough new law that will recognise sex without explicit consent as rape comes into effect in Sweden on Sunday, after the country was rocked by the #MeToo movement denouncing sexual harassment and assault.

 
 The law stipulates that a person has committed rape if they have been part of a sexual act in which the other person has not participated ""freely"".
 
 Rape had previously been defined as a sexual act carried out with the use of violence or threat.
 
 Now for someone to face rape charges, ""it is no longer necessary that violence or threats were applied, or that the aggressor took advantage of the victim's particularly vulnerable situation,"" according to the government.
 
 Courts will need to pay particular attention to whether consent was expressed with words, gestures or in another manner, and judges will have to rule on the issue, according to the law passed in May.
 
 Judge Anna Hannell, who helped create the law, said there was ""absolutely no requirement to formally say 'yes', to hit a button in an app or anything else of the same type"".
 
 ""Simply participating physically is a sign of consent,"" she told Swedish news agency TT.
 
 More than 7,000 rapes were reported in Sweden last year, a 10 per cent increase compared to 2016, latest official figures show.
 
 Rape is punishable by up to six years in prison, with a maximum penalty of 10 years if the victim is a minor.
 
 Backed by the ruling Social Democrat-Green coalition, the law has drawn criticism from several quarters including the Swedish lawyers' association and the national law council.
 
 Opponents say it will force judges to make arbitrary decisions on whether or not there was consent.
 
 However, the government has defended the legislation.
 
 ""#MeToo showed with force that a lot still needs to be done to fight sexual harassment and sexual violence at work and in the rest of society,"" Gender Equality Minister Lena Hallengren said in a statement on Sunday.
 
 The government will allocate 120 million krona (11.5 million euros/$13.5 million) to combat sexual abuse, she added.
 
 The #MeToo campaign exposing sexual misconduct, which began with the series of allegations against Hollywood mogul  , has shaken up nearly every sector in Sweden, one of the most gender-equal countries in the world.
 
 More than 10,000 women in Sweden -- including actresses, journalists, lawyers, musicians, doctors and construction workers -- have spoken up and campaigned against harassment.
 
 ""#MeToo is changing behaviours and people now understand the extent to which sexual violence is widespread,"" said Ida Ostensson of the Make Equal foundation, a key campaigner for the new law.
 
 ""We finally have legislation that protects physical and sexual integrity,"" she added.
 
 In May, the   announced there would be no Nobel Literature Prize this year following a major sexual assault scandal.
 
 The announcement came after Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter in November published the testimonies of 18 women claiming to have been raped, sexually assaulted or harassed by Jean-Claude Arnault, an influential culture figure with long-standing ties to the Academy. He has since been charged with two counts of rape.
 
 The scandal sowed deep discord among the institution's 18 members, prompting six to resign.
 
 ""It's important that society clearly states what is OK and what isn't,"" Erik Moberg, a Swede in his thirties, told AFP.
 
 ""It makes you think about your own behaviour and that of others.""

 Convener of Archdiocesan movement of transparency John Jacob filed the complaint. The association of Catholics within Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese was formed in the wake of church land sale row. 
 
 The complainant alleged that though Alencherry was informed of the incident six months ago, he didn’t take action.
 
 “He covered up the atrocity against womanhood by not alerting other church heads, including the Pope. He tried to protect the accused by not informing the women’s commission or the police about the incident. He was also a part of the group that threatened the woman so that she would be pressurised to withdraw the complaint,” alleged Jacob in the complaint.
 
 Official sources said that Vaikom DSP, who is probing the other cases related to the nun’s rape, will investigate this complaint as well. 
 
 The nun, who hails from Angamaly, belongs to the Missionaries of Jesus. The former mother superior had also served in Jalandhar diocese. Based on her complaint, bishop Mulakkal was booked for unnatural sex and rape by Kottayam police.
 
 Police said the bishop had first lodged a complaint against the nun, saying he was being threatened. He had lodged a complaint against six persons, including the nun. The complaint was filed with the Kottayam SP on June 21. The nun lodged the complaint after the bishop.
 
 The bishop reportedly said the nun was transferred on disciplinary grounds, and her complaint was an act of retaliation. Kuravilangad police registered a case based on the nun's complaint on June 27.
 
 Jalandhar diocese comes under the Latin Catholic Church and the bishop hails from Thrissur. Both Bishop and the nun had worked together at Jalandhar diocese. She later returned to Nedumkunnam near Kuravilangad, established the convent here and became its mother superior. She was removed from the post of mother superior in 2016.

 The woman, who was veiled at a press conference in Jalandhar a day before, came out in open in Ludhiana and said she won’t cover her face and those who have wronged her should do so. 
 
 Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) head Simarjeet Bains, who had organised the press conference, said the brave woman would be the brand ambassador of their campaign against addiction, which they would be launching on social media. They have also started a helpline against drug abuse, he added.
 
 Talking to mediapersons, the 26-year-old woman, said “On Thursday night after the press conference, I thought why should I cover my face? It is he who should do so. I am not happy with the action taken by the government against the DSP and want a severe punishment for him. I feel bad for boys and girls who have become victims of drug abuse. They should also come out of it with the support of society.”
 
 Daljit Singh Dhillon, former international hockey player last posted as DSP (headquarters) at Ferozepur, could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.
 
 Bains said, “Suspension of the DSP is an eyewash. The least the government could have done was get statement of the survivor recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC in the presence of a magistrate, register an FIR against him and hand over the case to the Special Task Force (STF). The government should also probe the nexus of which the DSP is part and punish the politicians, police officers, bureaucrats, if their involvement is established.”
 
 He added that he was moved by the images and videos of women in tears over drug overdose death of their children.
 
 He alleged that an inmate of Amritsar jail had told the STF that a drug racket existed inside the prison despite high security.
 
 Hinting at the chief minister’s pre-poll “pledge”, he asked, “What about people who took a pledge on the holy book that if voted to power they would end drug abuse in four weeks?”
 
 “When people stand up for a cause, the government wakes up. Our recent action has trembled them. We salute the courage of the woman who stood up against the drug abuse and decided not to cover her face,” said Bains, who is an MLA from Atam Nagar. 
 
 About his online campaign against addiction, he said his MLA brother Balwinder Singh Bains and he would monitor the social media portal and WhatsApp group and submit information to the chief minister and the STF. He also sought the support of Punjabis living abroad.

"Rape taint off 62-year-old, court laments no law to protect men",2018-06-27T00:59:07+05:30,"NEW DELHI: “Where is the law to protect men from women and children who implicate them in false cases” a Delhi   asked while acquitting a senior citizen accused of raping his minor   in October 2015. 

 The special Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) court said the girl had given different statements at different times and they were all riddled with inconsistencies. “The complainant’s numerous contradictions and inconsistencies as well as with that of her mother’s statements remain unexplained,” additional sessions judge Nivendita   said.
 
 The court observed that the plight of the 62-year-old   might continue despite the acquittal as it would have caused “uproar in the society since he was the maternal grandfather of the minor”. “His acquittal may not even be noticed. He will continue to suffer the stigma of being a rape-case accused. He has also remained in custody for a considerable period,” said the court.
 
 The nine-year-old complainant alleged that the man committed digital   on multiple occasions. He was accordingly chargesheeted, but claimed innocence. 
 
 In his statement in court, the man accused the girl’s mother of falsely implicating him as she wanted to usurp his property. In his defense, he said he had allowed his daughter to live in his house on humanitarian grounds, but she tutored her minor daughter, and filed a false case against him. He also alleged that the police forcibly obtained his signatures on blank papers. This case, according to him, was filed only because his younger daughter wanted to grab his property. 
 
 The court, however, found that the girl did not depose that her grandfather sexually abused her, in fact, gave an account of some previous alleged incidents which were neither reported nor mentioned in the complaint. 
 
 “There are numerous inconsistencies in the girl’s statements, especially regarding the manner in which the alleged offence was committed. It also cannot be ignored that the she as well as her mother have admitted in their cross examination that there was a dispute between the accused and the girl’s parents over the property, which indicates the possibility of false implication of the accused,” the court observed.
 
 A seemingly ‘untrue’ version of the girl’s statements prompted the court to observe that no reason had been shown as to why the man would jeopardise his future, and there is nothing on the record to show that he had committed the offence. “No one discusses about the dignity and honour of a man as everyone is only fighting for the rights, honour and dignity of women and children... Perhaps, now it is the time to take a stand for a man,” it added.

Kathua rape victim sank into coma due to overdose of sedatives: Forensic experts,2018-06-24T17:02:03+05:30,"JAMMU/ NEW DELHI: Overdose of sedatives, forcibly administered to an eight-year-old rape victim during her captivity in Kathua in January this year, could have pushed her into the coma before she was killed, forensic medical experts have said.

 
 The crime branch of the   police, probing the gang rape-and-murder case, sent a sample of her viscera to a forensic laboratory earlier this month to examine the effect of ""mannar"" candies (believed to be local cannabis) and Epitril 0.5 mg tablets, administered to the girl by her captors.
 
 According to the medical opinion received recently by the crime branch, the doctors said the tablet given to the eight-year-old girl could have pushed her into a state of shock or coma (loss of consciousness).
 
 The crime branch had asked the medical experts to comment upon the plausible effect of the medicine on an eight-year-old girl with an empty stomach.
 
 The crime branch decided to seek further medical opinion after it was claimed by the accused and their lawyers in the court, as well as on social media through their supporters, that it was virtually impossible that the girl could not have cried for help when such an alleged brutal attack was happening on her.
 
 The doctors, after examining the viscera, opined that the medicine administered to the victim contained Clonazepam salt and had to be administered under medical supervision keeping in mind the age and weight of the patient.
 
 ""Considering her (victim) 30-kg body weight, the therapeutic dose of 0.1 to 0.2 mgs per day divided in three doses for patient (is recommended),"" it said.
 
 ""She was forcefully administered five tablets of Clonazepam of 0.5 mg each on January 11, 2018 which is higher than the safe therapeutic dose. Subsequently, more tablets were given...the signs and symptoms of an overdose may include drowsiness, confusion, impaired coordination, slow reflexes, slowed or stopped breathing, coma (loss of consciousness) and death,"" according to the opinion of the medical expert.
 
 The peak concentration of Clonazepam is achieved in the blood after one hour to 90 minutes of oral administration and its absorption is complete, ""irrespective of administered either with or without food"", according to the concluding opinion of the medical expert.
 
 The opinion would be submitted before the district and sessions court in Punjab's Pathankot, hearing the matter, after the summer break next week. The trial of the case was shifted from Kathua (in Jammu) to   on the directions of the Supreme Court.
 
 The doctors said the risk is higher if Clonazepam is ""concomitant used with other CNS (inner nervous system) depressants like alcohol..."" The doctors, however, could not give any laboratory analysis of 'mannar' candies and said ""it is difficult to comment on the effect its co-administration with Clonazepam"" would have.
 
 'Mannar' is locally available cannabis, which keeps a person sedated for a few hours. The eight-year-old child belonging to a minority nomadic community was allegedly kidnapped on January 10 by a juvenile nephew of the main accused, Sanji Ram, and later killed on January 14. Her body was recovered on January 17.
 
 According to investigators, Sanji Ram was aware she had been kidnapped but didn't know about the rape.
 
 Besides Sanji Ram and his juvenile nephew, others named in the charge sheet filed by the crime branch are his son Vishal, special police officers Deepak Khajuria and Surender Verma and friend Parvesh Kumar alias Mannu.
 
 It also names head constable Tilak Raj and sub-inspector Anand Dutta -- who allegedly took Rs 4 lakh from Sanji Ram and destroyed crucial evidence. The district and sessions court in Pathankot framed charges of rape and murder against the seven accused in the case on June 8.
 
 Sanji Ram, considered the main accused, is alleged to have hatched the conspiracy with the other accused of kidnapping the girl as part of a strategy to remove the minority nomadic community from the area.
 
 The fate of the eighth accused, a juvenile, was yet to be decided after the crime branch of the Jammu and Kashmir police moved an application in the high court claiming him to be an adult.

In a glaring goof-up, the police made public the name of the suspect and the survivor's residential locality on Friday - thereby leaving her at risk of being identified as well. 

 
  Police not only issued a   with the suspect's picture and the arrest team posing alongside, but also paraded him in the heart of  . 
 
 Police have begun another round of parading and shaming of suspects in sexual crimes, notwithstanding the controversy their earlier attempt generated. In March, police conducted almost daily parades of such suspects, and videos went around showing cops encouraging passers-by - especially women - to beat them up. There is no data to show that it acted as a deterrent, but that didn't stop cops from going for a second round.
 
 In their eagerness to show how promptly they took action, cops rounded up the suspect for his niece's rape and got themselves photographed with him. This picture was used in a press note where the girl's address and his name was mentioned along with a long list of names of officers whose ""guidance and inspiration"" led to the quick arrest.
 
 Worse, when TOI called up Habibganj SHO Virendra Chouhan to ask why they had done so, he justified it by giving details - like number of siblings - that would further lead to her identification. 
 
 ""We have not named the survivor. Besides, she is not an only child and has XX siblings, so even if the name of her uncle was made public, her identity doesn't get disclosed,"" he said, adding that the accused was paraded to ""send a message to society"". 
 
 Bhopal DIG Dharmendra Choudhary was more concerned. He first responded by saying that the girl's name hadn't been revealed. But when he was told how police had indirectly made it easier to identify her, Choudhary promised that police ""would be more cautious in the future"". Advocate Ajay Gupta advised that police should not get ""over-excited"" and do something that could identify a rape survivor. 
 
 According to the girl's complaint, she had come to visit one of her uncles with her parents. She was alone when another uncle arrived on June 19 and took her home on some pretext. There, he allegedly held her confined and raped her repeatedly. She jumped off a balcony on Friday and ran into a neighbour's house to seek help. From there, she went to police.

Residents of Kochang village, however, said the school staff had not been informed about the reason of their “detention or arrest”.
 
 “They were picked up for interrogation and were released within 24 hours of detention,” Khunti SP   said. Sister Ranjita Kindo and sister Anita Nag, the nuns from the NGO staging the street play, were also questioned at the Khunti police station.
 
 Till Friday, no arrests have been made in the gang-rape. “We have obtained strong leads and the offenders will soon be apprehended,” IG (operations) and Jharkhand Police spokesperson Ashish Batra said.
 
 On Friday, Khunti Police released a photo, reportedly from a video grab of the gang-rape, of one of the suspects and announced Rs 50,000 cash reward for anyone providing concrete clues or helping with the identification of the culprits. “We have found that four to six people were involved in the incident.

Minor gives birth after being raped by father,2018-06-23T15:47:50+05:30,"NEW DELHI: A minor rape survivor’s   left no doubt in the mind of a special court that she was   by her   leading to her   and eventually resulting in the   of a child, who was put up for   at an orphanage. The “sordid” story has prompted the court to award   to the father for raping his juvenile daughter.

 “This case is a sordid story where the convict repeatedly committed penetrative sexual assault on his minor daughter for about one year, made her pregnant and subjected her to criminal intimidation,” said Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) judge Sanjay Garg.
 
 Calling the father’s crime a “dastardly” one, Garg opined that he had not only caused breach of trust and confidence of the minor survivor, but also inflicted “untold miseries” on her body, mind and psyche leaving scars that would never heal. “The remorse that sets upon the convict subsequently cannot free him of the virulent act he committed. Keeping in mind the odious nature of crime, the court is of the opinion that the convict is not entitled to any leniency,” he held.
 
 In September 2013, the 16-year-old girl was doing household chores when her unusually bulging belly caught her aunt’s attention. On inquiry, she revealed that her father had been raping her for over a year and that is how she got pregnant.
 
 When the accused was confronted, he escaped along with the younger daughter, it was alleged. On the basis of the survivor’s statement and information of her aunt, the police registered an FIR for rape (section 376 of IPC) and criminal intimidation (506). 
 
 The minor recorded her statement before a court on September 7, 2013 where she supported her version in the FIR even disclosing that she had told her mother about it but she did nothing as she is mentally unstable. The girl was medically examined and found to be 28 weeks pregnant at that time.
 
 Sections 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) and 10 (aggravated sexual assault) of the POCSO Act were added as she was a minor. On September 15, 2013, the father was arrested and thereafter the girl gave birth and the child was put up for adoption.
 
 Four years later, when the accused’s turn came to testify in his defense, he claimed innocence and called it a false case — a consequence of his disapproval of his daughter’s affair with a boy living in the neighbourhood. Saying that the child was born out of the affair, his counsel argued that no proof was brought forth by the prosecution to show that accused was the child’s biological father.
 
 The argument was termed “vacuous” by the court, which also added that the blood sample of the child was sent for forensic analysis for ascertaining his biological father, but the test could not be conducted as the sample had putrefied. In the meantime, the child was put up for adoption by the orphanage and a fresh blood sample, as a result, could not be obtained. The court’s decision, therefore, hinged primarily on the “reliable and trustworthy” testimony of the survivor. “Imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs 15,000,” it held and granted Rs 4 lakh compensation to the survivor.

 On September 27, 2016, the rape survivor’s mother lodged a complaint against her former husband that he raped their 12-year-old daughter. She said that she gave ‘khula’ (divorce) to her husband a few years ago and despite that he used to occasionally visit her house, where she and her daughter reside, in a drunken condition and harass them.
 
 “At 2pm on September 24, my ex-husband came to my house and locked me in a room and took our daughter to another room. I asked him to leave our daughter, but he did not listen to me. He raped the girl even though she was crying. I saw the whole incident from the room window,’’ the mother said, adding that their neighbour heard the screams of the girl and rescued the teenager.

 The convict sought lenient view of the court, citing ill health. “As the accused committed the rape of his own daughter, which is heinous in nature, this court is of considered opinion that he is not entitled for any lenient view. As the girl is minor and a tender aged girl, the accused is punished and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life,’’ Suneetha said in the order.

'Gender stereotypes hold back our children and hurt them emotionally',2018-06-25T17:15:45+05:30,"Blue is for  , pink is for  . This notion has been engraved in our minds since time immemorial, resulting in lifelong consequences over the two genders.
 
 Several studies have found that kids are confined into   in early adolescence.
 
 Because of the findings and the acceptability over the past few years, the concept of 'gender neutral' is growing fast.
 
 ""We read every day about problems that are a result of gender inequalities—gender pay gap, sexual violence of girls who are killed every year in India, of the economic cost and loss of talent and productivity. All these are big issues but each of them can be tackled if we pay more attention to the biases that fuel these problems,"" said Amita Malhotra, co-founder and facilitator of Candidly, a platform to talk about issues of gender, sexuality and media among children and young adults.
 
 ""People tend to under report their own bias and often enough are not even aware that they have a bias. A person who becomes aware of their bias has a better chance of being able to counteract them,"" Amita told ANI.
 
 When asked what effect does gender stereotyping have on the younger generation, she said, ""Gender stereotypes hold back our children and hurt them emotionally. From a young age, our children are exposed to limited and limiting ideas about what it means to be a boy or a girl. Think superhero culture that idolises aggression, dominance and emotional denial for boys; or, think of a princess culture which tells girls that their true value is in their beauty and physical appearance.""
 
 Amita added, ""Unrealistic expectations of beauty and sexiness for girls, especially in media, create a sense of anxiety, poor self-esteem and body-shame issues. Boys are constantly told to hide their true feelings. The 'Be tough' message aimed at boys correlates to higher risk-taking and impacts their health negatively. From binge drinking to drug abuse, risky driving to physical violence, they are pressured to fit the mode of toxic masculinity.""
 
 As a society, what is to be done to bridge the gender gap?
 
 ""By age 10, gender stereotypes are said to be deeply ingrained in minds of children. If we want to address gender bias, we do need to intervene at an early age,"" concluded Amita.

The husband claimed he fought tooth and nail to fend off the accused, all in their early 30s.

 Eastern railway (ER), however, claimed otherwise. In a statement, ER CPRO   said the couple were quarrelling on platform 4 in the Sealdah-Ranaghat section around 10 pm, when residents of the area intervened and asked them to leave. “The couple started fighting with the locals and were manhandled. Alerted, GRP and RPF reached the spot and rescued the couple. An FIR was registered with the Dum Dum GRP against unidentified people,” he said.
 
 But the couple, residents of Mardal at Kakinara in North 24-Parganas, said even lodging a complaint was a traumatic experience. The GRP personnel at Sodepur station allegedly refused to register a complaint and they were forced to travel to Dum Dum. But Ashesh Biswas, SP of railway police, Sealdah, claimed GRP escorted the couple to Dum Dum and helped them lodge the FIR. “There is no provision of filing a complaint at Sodepur. We are looking for the culprits,” he said.
 
 The couple claimed they were attacked around 10.45pm but none of the passengers alighting from a train that arrived paid heed to their cries for help. “We had been to my sisterin-law’s place at Nagerbazar and were returning from Dum Dum. My wife was angry over some issue and had started for home ahead of me. I called her up and told her to wait at the Sodepur station. On arriving, we had an altercation, when the accused, standing on platform 3, came over and accosted us. They demanded we proved we were a married couple. When we told them not to intervene, they attacked us and tried to drag my wife towards bushes by a pond next to the platform. I shouted for help, but to no avail. With no option left, I fought with the youths and did my best to save my wife. She, too, fought back. We appealed to the GRP to lodge a complaint, but they refused to help,” said the husband, employee of a chemical factory.

 Earlier, police officers involved in the investigation had said on record that some wayward youth of Sondiha village had sexually assaulted a teenage girl and her mother at gun point near Sondiah village of   police station area. 
 
 Two Sondiha youths-- Gaurav Sharma and Shivam Sharma--were identified by the rape survivors and two others, who were earlier robbed at the same place. The identification was done through a parade in which 20 suspects were presented before the victims.
 
 As per the findings of the SIT investigating the case, the crime was committed by the Paswan gang of robbers and not Sondiha youth.
 
 Asked whether Gaurav and Shivam, currently languishing in   Central jail, too were members of Paswan gang, SSP Rajiv Mishra said no evidence of the duo being a member of the said gang has surfaced. The new findings have changed the case narrative and there is also no clarity about the number of criminals involved. 
 
 Going by the details given by the SSP, the robbers’ gang had planned to commit dacoity somewhere else and as they assembled at the point of convergence somewhat earlier, they started random road robbery and the rape survivors too were first relieved of their belongings.
 
 According to zonal IG Naiyyer Hsanain Khan, he has directed the investigating team to collect enough scientific evidence to ensure justice in the case.

Delhi: Many twists and turns in 2013 rape-murder,2018-06-18T01:31:37+05:30,"NEW DELHI: A 2013 case of rape and murder of a woman scholar in Agra, where a Delhi school student is prime accused, has started mirroring the Arushi Talwar case, with serious contradictions emerging between local police, CBI and the prosecution. 

 Nisha,23, (name changed), a PhD scholar, was found dead in Agra-based Dayalbagh Educational Institute's bio-technology lab, with 12 deep cuts inflicted allegedly with a paper cutter and a surgical blade on March 15, 2013.
 
 Uday Sarup, grandson of a retired IAS officer, who is an influential person in Dayalbagh's Radhasoami Satsang Sabha, was arrested by Uttar Pradesh police after initial investigations, along with lab technician Yashveer Sandhu. As per the police, Sarup tried to rape and killed Nisha after she spurned his overtures, later destroying evidence with the help of Sandhu.
 
 After a public outcry forced the government to hand over the case to CBI, the agency took three years to prepare a mammoth 480-page chargesheet in 2016 accusing Sarup for rape, murder and causing disappearance of evidence, but gave Sandhu a clean chit.
 
 Now, in a fresh twist, a Supreme Court-appointed special independent public prosecutor in the case has accused CBI of ""bias"" and of suppressing evidence, terming the crime to be that of gang-rape and murder by Sarup and Sandhu.
 
 On the plea of the victim's family to transfer the trial of the case to Delhi, the apex court had last year appointed an independent SPP to steer prosecution. Nisha's father wanted the case shifted to Delhi since the family has relocated to the capital after her death.
 
 In an application filed in the trial court last month, SPP Asok Kumar Gupta has claimed that despite evidence, attention of the court was not drawn by the previous CBI prosecutor to the offences made out under IPC sections 376A (rape leading to injury which causes the death of the woman or causes the woman to be in a persistent vegetative state) and 376D (gang rape). The special prosecutor has alleged the CBI allowed ""defective"" and less grave charges of destruction of evidence to be framed by court in 2016, ignoring material evidence.
 
 In his plea for addition and alteration of charges, SPP Gupta has cited post mortem report, DNA sample report, expert forensic opinion and statements of witnesses to assert there is enough material to support the charges of murder in the course of committing rape by the duo.
 
 However, Sarup's lawyer Gajender Kumar highlighted in court how two independent investigating agencies are contradicting each other and acting as adversaries on facts. ""Both probe agencies reveal two different sets of alleged facts and end up junking each other's theory. We are left in the lurch due to these contradictions and ambiguity and have brought this to notice of the court,"" he told TOI. 
 
 In its chargesheet, CBI had concluded that Sarup raped and killed the young woman after finding her alone in the lab of the Dayalbagh Educational Institute, Agra. It said he gained access to the laboratory after getting hold of spare keys to the microbiology lab since despite not being a student of the subject, he was allowed privileged access.

Gujarat HC orders government to pay rape survivor Rs 3 lakh,2018-06-15T06:49:02+05:30,"AHMEDABAD: The   dismissed a petition by the state government, opposing a lower court’s order to pay a rape survivor from Una town Rs 3 lakh compensation, in accordance with the scheme for compensation prepared by the state and Centre following a Supreme Court order.

 Justice Dholaria rejected the state government’s insistence that Rs 1 lakh was the ceiling for compensation to rape survivors in the state and it couldn’t pay the victim and her family more than Rs 1 lakh. The HC told the rape survivor’s father to claim the Rs 3 lakh compensation from the competent authority. The government has been directed to pay the sum immediately.
 
 The case involves a 15-year-old rape survivor from Gir Somnath  . She was sexually assaulted in 2015. In March 2017, a special court convicted the accused and sentenced them to 10 years in prison for abduction, rape of the minor and for violation of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). The court also ordered the state government to pay the rape survivor’s family Rs 3 lakh as compensation according to the Victim Compensation Fund Guidelines, Schedule-I.
 
 The state government did not pay the compensation sum and in May 2017, wrote to the victim’s father that it would challenge the court order, because the sum was higher than the limit fixed under the   Victim Compensation Scheme, 2016.
 
 Interestingly, the state government forgot that following an SC order and in line with the Centre’s compensation scheme, it had issued a notification in July 2017 that a rape victim was eligible for Rs 3 lakh compensation. It continued to oppose the lower court order.
 
 Only when the rape survivor’s advocate, Bhavik Samani, supplied a copy of the July 2017 notification, did the government’s opposition end.
 
 After perusing the notification, Justice R P Dholaria said the government’s petition “deserves dismissal”.

"Delhi: For fifth month in a row, no dip in crime numbers",2018-06-16T01:41:39+05:30,"NEW DELHI: The latest data compiled by Delhi Police shows that crimes such as murders, kidnappings for ransom and rapes — prime indicators of a city’s   — are on an upward trend for the fifth consecutive month compared with last year.

 
 In the first five months of this year, 207 murders were reported against the 204 last year and 12 kidnappings compared with eight last year. From 851 rapes last year, the number of rapes recorded this year has risen to 888 cases. Among the recent cases is that of a stalker barging in on a woman’s home in   and sexually assaulting her. He is a repeat offender, the cops said.
 
 The first kidnapping of 2018 took place on January 1 when a business magnate’s son was abducted for a Rs 5-crore ransom. Then, a day before Republic Day, some men shot at a school bus driver and took away a five-year-old boy for a ransom of Rs 60 lakh.
 
 Though dacoity — in check in the capital for a number of years now — has slipped from 16 to 10 in the corresponding January-May periods, vehicle thefts have gone up to 18,157 from 16,197. Fatal accidents too have spurted, with 629 till May 31 against 585 last year, as have hit-and-run cases.
 
 The rise in crime this year not only contrasts with the situation in entire 2017, but the number of unsolved cases has also piled up. The   and robbery of a jeweller at his showroom and the robbery at two other jewellery stores remain unravelled.
 
 For their part, police argue that the rise in numbers reflect increased registration of incidents. They point out that snatchings dipped from 3,720 last year to 2,693, while the number of robberies went down from 1,315 to 1,158 in the first five months of this year. Sources observed that the apparent dip could be due to many snatchings being registered online and that data being collated separately by the Crime Branch.
 
 Despite these claims, sources within the force admitted that factors like frequent transfers of officers and additional load on other officers visibly affected policing in general. Some cops also opined that more meetings and less action on the ground had resulted in the crime graph going up.

Delhi court lets off rape accused as girl months short of 18,2018-06-14T02:34:42+05:30,"NEW DELHI: A   was let off by a city court after it observed that the girl was months short of attaining adulthood and was “well aware” of the pros and cons of running away with the accused willingly. Her father had lodged the case after she went missing.

 
 
 The prosecution had argued that she was a minor and her   was immaterial. However, special judge Balwant Rai Bansal took into consideration the bone ossification report which showed that she was a mere four months short of becoming 18 years of age. “The prosecutrix was at the age of discretion and was having enough knowledge of the consequences of having accompanied the accused with her free will and consent and having married him later.”
 
 The girl’s father had filed a complaint with police on December 7, 2012 stating that she had gone missing on December 3. He also said that the accused had run away with his daughter. The accused was eventually arrested in Aligarh,  .
 
 Upon interrogation by police, the accused said that he ran away with the girl to marry her despite knowing that she was a minor. They went to Agra, got married in a temple and stayed at his friend’s house as a married couple. Subsequently, they went to Aligarh where they stayed as man and wife in a rented accommodation. The girl, in her statement, had reiterated what the accused had said besides saying she had had sex with him willingly.
 
 According to the prosecution, the girl’s bone test determined her age between 10.2 and 15.8 years. The defence counsel argued that though the bone age of the survivor was between 10.2 years and 15.8 years and considering the margin of two years it comes close to 18 years, the age of discretion.
 
 The court observed that where it has been held that there can be two years’ margin in radiological examination and it is well settled that when two opinions are possible, the one favouring the accused has to be taken.
 
 “The prosecutrix was sensible and aware of the intention of the accused and she stayed with him voluntarily... She accompanied the accused wilfully and voluntarily and her consent being the age of discretion deems to be valid...,” the court held.

"Raise awareness about statutory rape, POCSO: HC",2018-06-14T06:17:52+05:30,"AHMEDABAD:   on Wednesday directed the Centre and the state governments to make people, especially teenagers, aware that having sex with minor is a statutory offence punishable with a minimum of 10 years imprisonment, even if it is done with consent.

 
 A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje ordered the state government to raise awareness about provisions of the   and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, which provide for minimum punishments of 7 and 10 years, respectively, for sexual intercourse with a girl younger than 18, even with her consent. The court observed that these laws need to be widely publicized to curb sexual offences against children.
 
 The HC said the law has to be applied in cases of consensual sex involving a minor, even in cases of love affairs. “Ignorance of the law cannot be an excuse,” the court said and added that courts cannot use their discretion to reduce punishment in such cases, because the harsher punishment of minimum 10 years as provided under POCSO Act, against the minimum 7-year jail in IPC, has to be awarded. This destroys the lives and careers of youngsters.
 
 The HC asked the state government to “think and create awareness about the laws in schools and colleges, more particularly, to make the present young generation/future generation aware of the consequences of the above laws”. 
 
  The HC registry is to send the order to the chief secretary and secretaries of the home, higher education and women and child development departments for further measures, because publicity of POCSO is mandated in section 43 of the Act.
 
 The HC ordered so while enhancing the jail term, from seven years to 10 years, of a 19-year-old boy who had eloped with a 15-year-old girl in  , said additional advocate general Prakash Jani. The judges believe wide publicity of POCSO provisions will serve dual purposes. It will have a deterrent effect on hardcore criminals. It may also prevent a teenager from having sexual intercourse with a girl below 18 with or without consent because he will know the law.
 
 The court said POCSO would stay only on the books if the public does not know the features of the Act. Children, parents, guardians and the public in general are to be made aware through all means of publicity – television, radio, newspapers, pamphlets and sign boards.

 The documents, are related to the ongoing defamation case between Kesha and Luke.
 
  
  
 According to a report, the documents reportedly contain Luke's refutation of three of Kesha's claims against him - previously known allegations that he gave the singer drugs against her will and that he raped her, as well as the previously undisclosed claim that he raped Perry.
 
 The claim was revealed in a text message sent from Kesha to Lady Gaga, according to the documents, which read in part, ""On February 26, 2016 (Kesha) sent a text message to Stefani Germanotta (Lady Gaga) which repeated (Kesha's) false claim that (Luke) had raped her.
 
 ""(Kesha) also falsely asserted that (Luke) had also raped Kathryn Hudson (Katy Perry)Following this text message conversation, and with (Kesha's) encouragement, (Gaga) spread negative messages about (Luke) in the press and on social media.""
 
 Previously, the existence of the text message had been publicly discussed, although its contents had not.
 
 The documents also reportedly said Perry has been deposed as part of the lawsuit, although there is no indication of what she said. Perry has never publicly accused Luke of sexual misconduct, although she has not worked with him professionally for several years.
 
 In a statement, Luke's legal team denied the accusations detailed in the court documents. 
 
 ""Katy Perry herself confirmed that Dr. Luke did not rape her. Kesha's accusation to the contrary - just like her other outrageous lies about Dr. Luke - is baseless and irresponsible, and it is disrespectful to both Katy Perry and Dr. Luke. In his defamation lawsuit against  , Dr. Luke seeks damages for the harm caused by these malicious falsehoods.""
 
 Luke's defamation lawsuit against Kesha the last remaining suit in a legal battle that began in 2014 when the pop star went public with claims that the producer had abused her. That year, Luke filed a complaint against Kesha for failing to work on a third album as required under her contract. 
 
 Kesha filed a countersuit, seeking to be released from the contract on the basis of allegations that Luke had raped her and verbally abused her over the course of several years. The courts have ruled against Kesha in every attempt to extricate herself from her contracts with him and his label, and last year she released an album, 'Rainbow', on the label containing several songs that obliquely reference her battles with the producer.

Law min scheme to fast track rape trial; wants MHA to implement it,2018-06-10T17:51:45+05:30,"NEW DELHI: The law ministry will soon propose a scheme that it wants the home ministry to implement to the Union Cabinet on setting up fast-track courts across India to try rape cases and strengthen the infrastructure for better investigations and swift prosecution.

 
 The new scheme to strengthen investigation and prosecution to deal with rape cases is part of an ordinance recently promulgated to allow courts to award the death penalty to those convicted of raping children aged up to 12 years.
 
 The Criminal Laws (Amendment) Ordinance amended the IPC, the CrPC, the Evidence Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
 
 While bringing out the ordinance, the government had decided to frame a scheme to set up an ""appropriate"" number of fast track courts to try rape cases in the states.
 
 The proposed scheme will include components on the strengthening of the physical infrastructure and prosecution machinery, provision of the required number of judicial officers for lower courts, additional posts of public prosecutors, dedicated investigators and special forensic kits.
 
 ""While the department of justice has initiated the action for preparation of the said scheme, it is felt that it would be appropriate that the scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs keeping in view the fact that most of the actions involved and stakeholders are being administered by the MHA,"" Secretary (Justice) in the Law Ministry has said in a recent letter to Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha.
 
 The law ministry would take the issue up with the MHA, he said.
 
 The proposal is expected to come up shortly before the Cabinet.
 
 In April, the government had issued an ordinance to provide stringent punishment, including death, for those convicted of raping minors up to the age of 12 years, amid a nation-wide outrage over cases of sexual assault and the murder of minors in Kathua and Surat and the rape of a girl in Unnao.
 
 New fast-track courts will be set up to deal with such cases and special forensic kits for rape cases will be given to all police stations and hospitals in the long term, according to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance.
 
 It stipulates stringent punishment for perpetrators of rape, particularly of girls below 16 and 12 years. The death sentence has been provided for rapists of girls under 12 years.
 
 The minimum punishment in the case of rape of women has been increased from a rigorous imprisonment of seven years to 10 years, extendable to life imprisonment.
 
 The measure also provides for speedy investigation and trial. The time limit for investigation of all cases of rape has been prescribed and has to be now completed within two months.
 
 The deadline for the completion of trial in all rape cases will be two months, officials said. A six-month time limit for the disposal of appeals in rape cases has also been prescribed.
 
 Enhancing the powers of the judiciary to provide stringent punishments in rape cases, the government had approved a number of measures such as strengthening the prosecution, besides setting up new fast-track courts in consultation with the states and high courts concerned.
 
 New posts of public prosecutors will be created and special forensic kits for rape cases given to all police stations and hospitals in the long term, the officials said.
 
 Dedicated manpower will be provided for investigation of rape cases in a time-bound manner.
 
 Special forensic labs exclusively for rape cases would also come up in each state.

RPF sanitizes gang-rape stretch along railway tracks,2018-06-10T07:22:03+05:30,"KOLKATA: The gang rape beside the railway   between the Park Circus and   stations on May 23 has spurred the Railway Protection Force (RPF) into action. Over the last fortnight, RPF personnel of Eastern Railway’s Sealdah Division have not only demolished hooch dens along the stretch, but have also busted gangs involved in drug-running and other illegal activities.

 
 “Ever since the incident occurred, we have arrested 25 people and booked them under several charges. Our patrol parties are on the move after dark every day and people have been caught red-handed with drugs and hooch. After the incident, we inquired from locals and realized that the crime rate in the stretch was very high. There were regular brawls and even gambling dens used to operate where drugs and hooch were sold. Several criminals from elsewhere in the city also gathered here at night, making life miserable for people living nearby. This crackdown will continue for now,” said a senior RPF officer of the Sealdah Division.
 
 According to railway officials, the Government Railway Police (GRP) should be more active in checking crime along the tracks. The RPF’s primary duty is to save railway property and prevent crime against passengers at stations and on trains. Stretches like the one between Park Circus and Sir Gurudas Banerjee Halt are more vulnerable. “This is a loop line and there are few trains later in the evening. Criminals take advantage of this. The   pays half the cost of the GRP so they may guard such places. Unfortunately, their performance hasn’t been satisfactory,” an official said.
 
 
 A GRP official said the force is not sufficiently equipped to fight crime along railway tracks. Criminals are aware of this and choose deserted tracks to commit crimes as city or   police forces have no jurisdiction there. Even now, criminals store dangerous items like crude bombs next to the tracks.
 
 
 “We are taking pro-active steps to bring down crime along the tracks. All the 25 people have been nabbed red-handed and prosecuted. We shall carry out drives along all stretches where such illegal activities go on. After our patrolling started, crime has come down in the area,” said K M Siraj, inspector-in-charge, RPF, Sealdah.

Losing virginity doesn't give licence to rape: CBI court,2018-06-07T09:25:39+05:30,"CHANDIGARH: The CBI court in Chandigarh on Wednesday ruled that a person does not have licence to rape any girl or woman who has lost her virginity. The court also raised the issue of sexual violence faced by poverty-stricken girls across the country while sentencing former BSF DIG KC Padhi and J&K police ex-DSP Mohammad Ashraf Mir for raping a minor. 

 
 The court sentenced the two former police officers along with three other convicts to 10-year jail in the 2006   sex scandal case. The court had on May 30 convicted the five men after a 12-year trial.
 
 ""The minor first became a victim of structural violence ie poverty and then due to poverty she became victim of sexual violence ie rape committed by the convicts,"" the court said.
 
 The CBI court also heavily criticized Padhi and Mir, the two former senior police officers. ""Killing more than 40 (militants) in the Valley does not overshadow or condone his act of committing rape upon the victim,"" the court said in its ruling on Padhi, as it refused to consider his stint in the   as a mitigating factor.
 
 
 
 
 
 The commission of offence committed by Padhi cannot be ignored because he had served the country by performing his official duties efficiently at the risk of his and his family life.”
 
 
 ""In the opinion of the court, killing militants at the risk of his life and being target of militants in the Valley does not fall in the category of mitigating factors.”
 
 
 The quantum of sentence in the case did not exceed 10 years as the convicts were tried under Section 376 of the Ranbir Penal Code, and not POCSO Act that came into effect in 2012. Sources in the prosecution told TOI that the sentences would have been longer under the POCSO Act.
 
 
 The court fined Padhi and Mir Rs 1 lakh each. The three other convicts, Shabbir Ahmad Laway (surrendered militant), Shabbir Ahmad Langoo, and Masood Ahmad alias Maqsood were also sentenced to 10 years in jail and were fined Rs 50,000 each.
 
 
 “The fines will be compensation (to the survivor) for the loss of her reputation, dignity, mental harm and loss of opportunity of education. A victim of rape inevitably suffers acute trauma. Rape itself brings enormous shame to the victim,” the court said.
 
 
 In its judgment, the court was clear that the survivor was a minor. “The question as to whether she had been habitual to sexual activity or not is immaterial to determine the issue of consent.”
 
 
 The case involved nine accused and four survivors. Prime accused Sabeena and her husband Abdul Hamid Bulla, who allegedly ran a brothel in Srinagar, died during the trial.
 
 
 Two of the accused — businessman Mehrajuddin Malik and then additional advocate-general of Jammu and Kashmir Anil Sethi — were acquitted by the court.
 
 
 The five men were convicted on the statement of one of the four minor survivors in the case. Three survivors had turned hostile during the course of the 12-year trial. The fourth survivor was kept in CBI protective custody and she stuck to her statement despite pressure and threats to her life.

Jharkhand girl rape: Cook ‘didn’t know she was pregnant’,2018-06-08T07:54:00+05:30,"GURUGRAM: The   who allegedly raped a   girl trafficked to the city at their employer’s house was arrested on Wednesday from Uttar Pradesh. He told police he had no idea about her pregnancy. The girl has accused him of repeatedly raping her for almost a year till he went home on a holiday. 

 
 Mohit Prasad Thakur (27) was arrested from his wife’s maternal uncle’s house in Bhonapur, where he was hiding, on Wednesday. Investigations revealed that not only has he been married for five years, he also has a 3-year-old daughter. “The accused stated that he had no idea about the girl’s pregnancy, and had gone home on a holiday. He has, however, confessed to raping the girl,” sub-inspector Manjusha, the investigating officer, told TOI.
 
 Thakur was brought to Gurugram and taken to court on Thursday and sent him to custody. Meanwhile, the girl has started to breastfeed her child after several rounds of counselling. She delivered a baby girl at General Hospital in Civil Lines on May 31. However, she has still not agreed to accept the baby. The child welfare committee (CWC) is trying to establish the girl’s age.
 
 According to investigations, the girl was probably abducted from her house in Gumla, Jharkhand, two years ago. In fact, three girls went missing around the same time from her village around Diwali in 2016. The distraught families made all efforts possible to trace the girls and even reported the matter to the police, but to no avail.

Nor did they receive the salary of Rs 3,500 per month for the first year and Rs 4,500 per month for the second year that the girl earned. Her employer was giving her wages to an agent, who told the girl that he was sending it to her family. Back in Gumla, her family continued to live in poverty while the girl was sexually abused in Gurugram.
 
 “Our focus is to help the girl get compensated for her labour as per Haryana labour laws after her age is determined. She will be reimbursed by her employer at Rs 9,000 a month for eight hours of service for six days a week plus overtime. We are searching for the trafficker. He can play a vital role in rescuing the other two girls as well,” said Balkrishan Goel, member, State Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

Kathua case: Charges of rape and murder framed against 7 accused,2018-06-08T08:12:36+05:30,"PATHANKOT: A court here, hearing the brutal   of an eight-year old girl in   in   and Kashmir, on Thursday framed charges against seven of the eight accused, paving way for beginning of trial against them, officials said here.

 
 The district and sessions court has framed charges under various sections of the Ranbir Penal Code including 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 302 (murder) and 376-D (gang  ), special public prosecutor J K Chopra said here.
 
 The accused against whom charges were framed were Sanji Ram, his son Vishal, special police officers   alias Deepu and Surinder Verma, Parvesh Kumar alias Mannu, head constable Tilak Raj, and sub-inspector Arvind Datta.
 
 Sanji Ram is considered to be the main accused who is alleged to have hatched the conspiracy with other accused for kidnapping the girl as a carefully planned strategy to remove the minority nomadic community from the area.
 
 The fate of the eighth accused, who is a juvenile and nephew of Sanji Ram, was yet to be decided after the crime branch of Jammu and Kashmir Police claimed that he was an adult, Chopra said.
 
 The court also framed charges for destruction of evidence and under section 328 (causing hurt by poisoning with an intent to hurt) of the RPC. The two policemen -- Tilak Raj and Arvind Datta --were also charged under Section 161 (public servant taking illegal gratification) of the RPC, the special public prosecutor said.
 
 The defence counsel contested before judge Tejwinder Singh that Parvesh Kumar was a juvenile which was strongly opposed by the prosecution, he said, adding the judge has asked the state to file their objections.
 
 The crime branch had filed a charge sheet on April 9 in Kathua in the case of kidnap, rape and murder of the eightyear-old girl from January 10 this year. She was killed on January 14 and her body was recovered on January 17 triggering a massive political unrest in the state.
 
 According to the charge sheet, the victim was held in captivity at a small village temple in Kathua district where she was kept sedated and sexually assaulted before she was bludgeoned to death. The eightyear-old had gone missing on January 10 while grazing horses in the forest. Investigators said the accused juvenile had abducted the girl on the pretext of helping her find her horses.
 
 According to the charge sheet, the accused gave the girl sedatives to make her unconscious while holding her in captivity at the 'Devisthan'. The juvenile, a school dropout, turned out to be the main player in the abduction and murder, raping the child repeatedly along with Vishal and Khajuria.
 
 On January 23, about a week after the body was discovered, the government handed over the case to the crime branch, which formed a Special Investigation Team.
 
 “... in the course of investigation, it transpired that somewhere in the first week of January, accused Sanji Ram decided to put a plan to dislodge the Bakherwal community from the area which had been brewing in his mind for quite sometime, into operation and in pursuance to that he made accused Deepak Khajuria, a special police officer, and his nephew (juvenile) as part of the conspiracy and assigned them tasks separately and individually,” the charge sheet said.
 
 Sanji Ram surrendered on March 20 after his son was arrested from   a day earlier. Investigations revealed that Sanji Ram gave Rs 4 lakh to the police officers investigating the case in three installments. The chargesheet explained in detail how the accused police officials destroyed crucial evidence by washing the clothes of the victim before sending them to the forensic laboratory and created false evidence at the scene.
 
 The trial in the case began on May 31 with the seven accused being produced before the district and sessions judge after the Supreme Court transferred the case from Jammu and Kashmir to   for a fair trial following a plea by the victim’s family. While transferring the case, the apex court directed day-to-day in-camera trial in the case.

After going through the   of the incident, the court concluded on Friday that the sexual act between her and the accused was  .

 
 For judge Anu Grover Baliga, the footage from CCTV cameras at the alleged crime scene was the deciding factor. ""The prosecutrix is seen in the DVD to be hugging and kissing the accused and disrobing herself,” the judge observed. “The images make it apparent that there was consensual physical intercourse between the accused and prosecutrix.”
 
 The judge said, “The scientific evidence makes it patently apparent that the prosecutrix has falsely alleged the accused of raping her.” While acquitting the accused, a New Delhi resident, the court also opined that the woman “should be punished” for having given false evidence.
 
 According to the woman, soon after getting divorced in 2007, she got in touch with a man on a matrimonial portal. She leased a flat for herself and her daughter under the accused’s name. On March 19, 2013, she received a notice from the landlord asking her to vacate the house. Since the rent agreement was in the accused’s name, she went to his office-cum-residence, where, she alleged, the man offered her coffee. She fell unconscious after drinking it, and on gaining consciousness, she found herself lying half-naked on the carpet with a tissue paper in her genitals.
 
 The man contested the woman's allegations saying he had maintained physical relations with her since 2007 and paid her Rs 15,000- Rs 20,000 to meet monthly expenses. He did not want to marry her as she “wasn’t very educated”. He told the court that when the woman did come to his office-cum-residence, he was very angry to find she had forged his signatures on the lease documents. He called his lawyer, who advised him against giving her any assistance.
 
 The man also testified that during that meeting, the woman started fondling him and this led to sex. Later, when he came out of the toilet, he discovered she had left with some money from his wallet. He had filed an FIR against her in connection with the forgery.
 
 The man argued that having realised he was not going help her, the woman wanted revenge. The defence pointed out that footage from the CCTV camera in the room clearly proved the woman “seduced the man into making love” and took care to “preserve the evidence” of the act — the tissue paper with which she cleaned her genitals.
 
 The court found the CCTV footage and forensic report on the coffee found in the room negating all the contentions of the woman. “This court does agree … that action should be taken against the prosecutrix for having given false evidence regarding the incident of rape,” the verdict held.

‘Vague’ medical reports of rape survivors irk Muzaffarpur SSP,2018-06-09T01:00:00+05:30,"PATNA:   SSP Harpreet Kaur on Friday said she would write to the state police headquarters, urging it to ensure constitution of a medical board with dedicated team of doctors for medical examination of all the 44 minor girls who were rescued from a ‘children home’ following reports of their sexual abuse recently.

 The medical examinations of the rescued girls are being conducted at different government hospitals in   and Madhubani. The SSP is dissatisfied with the reports made available by the doctors concerned.
 
 “The tests are not being conducted properly. Vague medical reports are being given by the doctors,” Kaur told TOI. The SSP added she would also urge the police headquarters to involve police officers from Crime Investigation Department (CID) in the probe.
 
 Sources said instead of doctors, nurses were given the responsibility of conducting medical tests on eight girls at New Gardiner Road Hospital in Patna. “It was only after the intervention of   State Women’s Commission chairman Dilmani Mishra and Patna civil surgeon Pramod Jha that doctors were asked to conduct tests,” they alleged.
 
 On June 4, when a police team reached Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) with eight other rescued girls of the children home for x-ray, there was none to attend to them. “The x-rays were conducted in the emergency ward of the hospital more than three hours after the arrival of the girls,” the sources added. “The girls are also being exposed to common people. They should have been attended by the doctors separately,” they said.
 
 Meanwhile, Dibesh Kumar Sharma, assistant director, district child protection unit, Muzaffarpur, on Friday said the number of rescued girls was 44 and not 46 as was claimed earlier.
 
 The alleged sexual abuse of the girls at the children home came to light through a social audit report of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences-Mumbai, following which an FIR was lodged with the Women’s police station in Muzaffarpur on May 31. The NGO proprietor, Brajesh Thakur, and the NGO’s seven women office-bearers as well as children welfare committee member Vineet Kumar Verma have since been arrested.

"Anoushka Shankar: Rather than teaching women how to not get raped, we should teach men not to rape",,"On a day visit to Mumbai, six-time   award nominee, daughter of the late   legend  ,   talks to us on a variety of subjects like how her music brings her back to her roots, how   can penetrate the young generation, and most importantly, her views on how sexual abuse needs to be eradicated. Read on...

 
 I think when you come from a place of individuality and integrity, it just connects. It’s about knowing and being comfortable with the fact that the sitar is from India and it connects me to this country. At the same time, my music transcends borders, which you see in my personality as well.
 
 
 I grew up listening to trance and electronic as well, so it’s fine (laughs!). I think mostly, people are smarter than we give them credit for. It’s possible for people to listen to multiple genres of music. I grew up doing the normal young things and still learnt how to play the sitar. There are schools and families who take effort to ensure classical music is passed on to the younger generation. That’s enough, and I think the tradition will continue on the basis of how beautiful Indian classical music is.
 
 
 There are very few forms of music that cater to the lowest common denominator, or are popular to the extent that everyone will like them. So in that sense, yes, classical music is niche. But what I always say is that music can be listened to and appreciated on different levels. One can listen to something like Indian classical music with zero understanding and appreciate it on one level. By doing that, it is less intimidating. And obviously, if you like it and have enough curiosity around it, then you would want to learn it. Then there are 100 other levels in which you can enjoy it and the world opens up to you a lot more. That’s true of western classical music, like jazz as well. The more you understand, the more layers you appreciate, but you don’t have to know those layers to appreciate the music.
 
 
 Yes, of course! That’s how I ended up learning it. There was definitely an expectation, but I was never forced to do it. I totally had the choice, but I was also aware that there was a vested interest in my learning to play the sitar.
 
 
 At the moment, my kids are so young that I don’t have any vested interest in passing on my craft to them. It’s more about bringing them up in an environment of art, creativity and passion. I try to help them tap into their passion, which will ultimately make them happy.
 
 
 To make a subtle differentiation, our focus should be on how to eradicate sexual violence, not on how to protect ourselves from sexual violence. It should not be happening! Rather than teaching women how to not get raped, we should teach men not to rape. Obviously, our priority is to always keep our children and families safe. Education, culture, mindset, a lot of factors like these are responsible for sexual violence, and that’s where the focus should be. It is 
 disturbing to hear stories of sexual abuse that are happening around us and it affects me deeply. This was the feeling that led me to speak about it in the first place. I wish the conversations amongst decision makers of the country were more about how to change mindsets, culture and perception, rather than only focus on laws. It’s also about prevention and not just punishment. It’s more important to talk about how to eradicate sexual violence.
 
 
 People in the entertainment business have a voice and if we are able to use that voice to help make a change, then we should do it. We have an opportunity which some of the other people don’t necessarily have. So, when we start speaking, other people subconsciously begin to feel that they also have an opportunity to speak. In that sense, we have a responsibility. 
 
 
 Like anything else, I am dealing with it one day at a time and finding my way around it. The focus as a parent, regardless of whether you are a couple or a single parent is to raise your children well and keep them as happy as possible.

Sexual violence is holding back the rise of India's economy,2018-05-30T16:26:35+05:30,"NEW DELHI: There are two things New Delhi marketing executive Khyati Malhotra never leaves home without: Her taser and a pepper spray.

 
 It’s just part of the investment she makes to stay safe in a country where crimes reported against women have surged over 80 per cent in a decade and deadly cases of   often roil cities and villages. So a chunk of Malhotra’s salary goes into a car and driver to avoid the dangers of public transport, where women are cat-called, groped and assaulted.
 
 In Bangalore, Vidya Laxman, an executive at a multinational in India, pays for a battalion of household help and security cameras to keep her children safe. Sajna Nair of Delhi figures she’s lost almost Rs 1.35 crore in earnings after quitting a bank job because she couldn’t find safe childcare for her daughter.
 
 In recent months, the rape, torture and murder of an eight-year-old girl in the state of Jammu, an 11-year old in Gujarat and the   of 16-year old in Uttar Pradesh have laid bare how India treats its women and children. Lawmakers have said they will push for more stringent punishments to deter such crimes. Meanwhile, dozens of interviews reveal a less acknowledged economic effect: Increasingly afraid for their own and their children's safety, many women are simply leaving the workforce or taking lower-paying jobs.
 
 In the eight years from 2004, about 2 crore women (the size of the combined populations of New York, London and Paris) vanished from India’s workforce, the   estimates.
 
 “There’s no place where I could leave my child without worrying about safety,” said Indu Bhandari, who quit a lucrative corporate career to teach because of those worries. “Having been a target of sexual abuse as a child, I knew first-hand what I could be exposing my child to.”
 
 Decisions like hers are a blow to foreign and local companies looking to hire more women in Asia’s third largest economy. They also threaten Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s agenda as he pushes to attract foreign investment and boost India’s economic heft globally. India shows just how much violence and sexual assault against women can hold back communities — and an entire nation.
 
 India could increase its   by Rs 51.50 lakh crore by 2025 by getting more women to work and increasing equality, according to McKinsey Global Institute. Yet, only 27 per cent of Indian women are in employment. That’s the lowest among the major emerging nations and G-20 countries, and better only than Saudi Arabia, according to the publication IndiaSpend.
 
 “If we are able to establish a safer environment, definitely more women will step out for jobs, adding to the workforce,” said Anjali Verma, an economist at PhillipCapital in Mumbai. “In a decade this may contribute to higher overall consumption, savings, and economic growth.” Girija Borker, a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Brown University, in a study of more than 4,000 women at Delhi University found female students willing to pay almost Rs 20,000 more than men for a safer travel route because most faced some form of street harassment. “With the rapid urbanisation, India needs better policies for women's safety,” Borker said.
 
 In India, preference for male children has skewed the gender balance, leading to a whopping 3.7 crore more men than women. Two-thirds of the country live in villages that follow feudal, caste and gender hierarchies. That means many women never make formal complaints when they are harassed, and perpetrators often go unpunished. It also makes it hard to draw international comparisons.
 
 Crimes against women surged 83 per cent from 2007 to 2016, government data show, resulting in 39 crimes every hour. 
 
 Public pressure forced lawmakers to recommend the death penalty for child rapists and they are debating a similar punishment for the rape of women. Many businesses are spending more on transport and other benefits to women. Yet filling all the gaps is hard.
 
 “In most advanced economies there are social structures, better travel infrastructure, better creches,” said Nanda Majumdar, who heads intellectual capital and professional development at law firm Nishith Desai Associates. 
 
 Nair said she could have invested earnings from her more lucrative financial career in the property or stock markets. She now runs a public relations business.
 
 In New Delhi, Zeba, 25, is heartbroken after male family members refused to let her go to nursing school after a rape nearby. “Things would have been so different if I was a man,” said Zeba. “I would certainly have been richer.”
 
 Below are excerpts from the women Bloomberg interviewed. In their own voices they show the price India’s women — and its economy — are paying.
 
 
 
 
 Indu Bhandari, 39, lives in Noida, a suburb east of Delhi. Worked for corporations for more than a decade and was in the US before returning to India.I was first abused as a three-year-old by a man who worked at our home. One of my father’s colleagues abused me when I was six years old.
 
 On giving up a well-paid freelance gig: I had to use public transport for part of my travel. There was no separate compartment for women. I remember how one man rubbed himself against me. I punched him. But such an incident shakes you up, disgusts you. I tried to brave it for three months or so. But then decided I’d had enough.
 
 How could I work when I know these things happen to kids in our homes? I had no safe options. So I gave up a lucrative career. I now teach at a school.
 
 There are thousands of mothers who like me are working in schools in spite of being qualified to do so many other things.
 
 
 
  
 Sajna Nair, 42, lives and works in Delhi.
 
 Given the reported and unreported but whispered stories of abuse and neglect, I remember doing things like requesting neighbors or friends to drop in unannounced to check on my child. But it became tough to balance this paranoia. I simply quit. This country doesn’t care for its daughters and women.
 
 If I had continued, I would have been an associate vice president or vice president at some company. And of course, companies have lost the money they invested in training me.
 
 
  
  
 Vidya Laxman, 45, works in Bangalore, now called Bengaluru.
 
 After reading about the recent rapes, the trust in the community is gone. I’m a marathon runner but I don’t run early mornings or late evenings. I wait until it’s fully light. I used to be scared of encounters with stray dogs and creepy men.
 
 Now I’m no longer afraid of the dogs, I’m terrified of the men who flash women on the streets. When I take an Uber, I always get off a little distance off and walk home. I don’t want the driver to find out where I live.
 
 At home, I have a full support system in place as I have two kids, a 16-year-old boy and a 11-year-old girl. I always take precautions while hiring staff, including thorough background checks. I have security cameras installed at home.
 
 What I pay to set all this up is one thing. But it’s the hidden price that is troubling. I’ve decided to put in sensor-based cameras so that my husband and I can track the stream on our cellphones.
 
 At work, we have upgraded transport systems for employees and enabled it with technology. We have an app that allows users to set off an alarm if needed.
 
 Career-wise I’ve made big compromises. I only considered offers from product-based companies and deliberately ignored roles in services companies because of the insane travel involved.
 
 Companies need to partner with the government and civic agencies on women’s safety. Companies in tech parks all over Bangalore can all get together to work out solutions for their employees’ safety. There are many women who drop off the work force because of the late hours and the safety angle. We are letting those women down. We have to find a way. 
 
 
 
  
 Khyati Malhotra lives in New Delhi.
 
 For as long as I can remember, I’ve always had a car and driver, even when the driver’s salary and petrol expenses meant half of my salary. Traveling in public transport whenever I tried to save money meant having to watch my back at all times and gave me goosebumps.
 
 I’ve been stalked even when traveling by car. Once the auto-rickshaw I was traveling in was being followed by a group of guys in a car. When we stopped at a traffic light, we found a police van waiting by our side. I told the policeman what was happening. the police simply drove away.
 
 A friend’s car was trailed by a man for more than 20 kilometers while she was trying to drop me to a train station.
 
 
 
 Zeba, 25, works in Madanpur Khadar, a low-income settlement on Delhi’s outskirts.
 
 I don’t want to depend on anyone for my finances -- not on my husband or on my brothers. I want a career in nursing because you can also go abroad. Earlier this year, I had found a course in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh.
 
 I had managed to convince my family. We filled admission forms. Then last month there was a rape in Dadri. Now my brothers have put their foot down. They say it’s too unsafe.
 
 People keep saying things are getting worse. And I think they are. Especially after the 2012 rape. People say more women are complaining. But I feel like more men are also challenging us now. It’s like: “You think you will be protected if you speak up, we’ll make it worse.”
 
 With every rape case in the news, restrictions increase. I’m under pressure to get married. To not pursue a career.
 
 
 
  
 Monika Ghosh, 40, works in Noida.
 
 A woman with no support systems has limited choices. If there were systems to protect me, things would have been so much easier. If there were jobs, creches, safe roads.
 
 I now work at a home in a gated community and make about Rs 12,000 a month. But I could earn up to Rs 20,000 if I stay full time or at least till 8 pm.
 
 The reason why I can’t is because the place where I work in Noida has no buses or safe transport. There are villages beyond these gated societies and the roads are unsafe.

High security at Pathankot court ahead of Kathua rape-murder case trial,2018-05-31T11:39:51+05:30," (PUNJAB): A thick security blanket was today thrown in around the four-storey judicial court complex here and all necessary arrangements were done to ensure a smooth trial in the sensational   case.

 
 The case, involving the rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl from a nomadic community in   district in January, was transferred by the Supreme Court from Jammu and Kashmir to Pathankot.
 
 The apex court, had on May 7, also directed day-to-day in-camera trial in the case.
 
 The eight persons arrested in the case will be produced before the district and sessions judge here in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court.
 
 The court had asked the district and sessions judge at Pathankot to personally undertake the trial proceedings and not assign it to other session judges, stating that it would monitor the progress of trial in the case and no other courts should entertain any other plea related to the matter.
 
 The trial in the case will be held according to the provisions of Ranbir Penal Code, which is applicable in Jammu and Kashmir.
 
 Pathankot Bar Association president Reshpaul Thakur said this was for the first time such a high-profile case was to be heard in the court.
 
 The Punjab authorities have made elaborate security arrangements to ensure smooth trial in the case.
 
 A large number of policemen, including women personnel, have been deployed within and outside the court complex. The main entrance of the complex has been blocked for vehicles, including those belonging to the staffers, who were asked to park their vehicles in an adjacent complex.
 
 CCTV vans were also deployed in the court premises to keep an eye on trouble makers.
 
 The policemen were seen in riot gear, some armed with guns and most of them carrying batons and shields.
 
 Special security squads armed with mine detectors and sniffer dogs were doing the rounds to sanitise the complex, where the police have set up barricades outside the main door.
 
 ""All necessary arrangements are in place to ensure smooth trial in the case,"" a senior police officer supervising the security arrangements in and outside the court, told PTI.
 
 Officials said a police team along with staff of Kathua's district and sessions judge will present the files of the case to the court here and request permission to translate the documents from Urdu to English.
 
 The Crime Branch had submitted a charge sheet in the case on April 9 before the Kathua court.
 
 The case came into the limelight after lawyers of the Kathua bar association reportedly tried to prevent the police from submitting the documents. 
 
 According to the 15-page charge sheet, the eight-year-old girl, who was kidnapped on January 10 this year, was allegedly raped in captivity in a small village temple in Kathua district. She was kept sedated for four days before being bludgeoned to death.

'Death penalty ordinance for raping a child not linked to Kathua',2018-05-31T15:51:58+05:30,"NEW DELHI: The ordinance imposing the death penalty for raping a child was in the pipeline for long and was not brought because of the nationwide outrage over the rape and murder of a minor in   in Jammu and Kashmir, a top official in the Women and Child Development (WCD) ministry has said.

 
 ""It was a criminal law amendment bill piloted by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). And we (WCD ministry) extended our full support to it. The introduction of the new amendment has nothing to do with the Kathua rape incident,"" WCD Secretary   told IANS.
 
 ""Our minister ( ) had pitched about it earlier much before the ordinance came into action. We had already moved the suggestion to the law ministry and it was announced on due time,"" Srivastava added.
 
 The ordinance, which amended the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Posco), brought down the age of the victims from 18 to 12 years. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), a statutory body under the WCD ministry, has been mandated to monitor Pocso.
 
 However, the government's move has not been welcomed by lawyers, NGO workers and human rights activists. According to them, the existing act was strong enough and the new law will have a negative impact on the minds of both the victim and the accused.
 
 ""Different viewpoints have emerged when the new amendment came into limelight but we haven't examined all the opinions. I agree we didn't consult with the NGOs or human rights activists before enforcing the act which we should have done, but we always go through all the ideas which are suggested to us,"" he pointed out.
 
 Asked whether the death penalty is the ultimate solution to curb rape cases and reduce incidents of sexual harassment, the secretary insisted that the new act will serve as a deterrent both for criminals and the judiciary with a timeframe now being laid down for trying cases under the act.
 
 ""The stringent act will force the criminals to think before committing the heinous crime; there will be a fear of facing the death penalty. This will reduce the rate of crimes against children in the country,"" he maintained.
 
 Recently a court in Madhya Pradesh sentenced to death a man found guilty of raping a minor. Pointing to this, the Secretary said that the district courts have started to act quickly on such cases and they are serious about the issue.
 
 However, currently over 112,000 cases under the Pocso are pending before various district courts and High Courts. As per the NCRB data, the pendency rate of Pocso act cases was 89 per cent whereas conviction rate was only 29.6 per cent.
 
 According to activists and lawyers, lack of professionals for Pocso cases at the district level often leads to delays in proceedings.
 
 When asked whether the ministry is working on bringing a quick solution to the large number of pending cases, Srivastava said that the WCD is also pitching for fast track courts so that day-to-day hearings can be conducted.
 
 ""Also the time limit for hearing a case has been decided at two months,"" he noted.
 
 The secretary also added that the ministry is equally concerned about the sexual abuse that boys below the age of 12 face and are therefore working towards bringing another amendment in the Pocso.
 
 ""It (Pocso) has always been gender neutral. Sexual harassment during childhood is faced equally by boys and girls. Under Section 5 of the Pocso act, Criminal Law Act 2013 will undergo the change and it will be introduced by WCD only,"" he stated.

Kottiyoor rape: Accused priest denied bail again,2018-06-01T00:07:38+05:30,"Kochi: The high court has, for the second time. declined bail to the priest accused of raping a minor girl though over a year has passed since the alleged incident took place.

 Justice Sunil Thomas declined bail to main accused father Robin alias Mathew Vadakkencheril, who was the vicar of Neendunokki parish at Kottiyoor under Mananthavadi diocese of Syro Malabar Church. According to the prosecution, the priest had raped the 16 year old when she arrived at church premises to attend computer classes.
 
 The court directed that the investigation team should file the chargesheet within 40 days after completing the probe and the trial in the case should be completed within six months.
 
 In the bail plea, the priest contended that he has been in jail since February last year and trial proceedings have not started yet. In these circumstances, he should be granted bail (by imposing strict conditions, if required), it was said.
 
 Senior public prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy, strongly opposing the bail plea, argued that there was high chance of the accused influencing the rape survivor and her family as they belong to the same denomination of the church. “This is a case where the survivor had initially implicated her father to save the priest. Finally, the baby delivered by the survivor was subjected to DNA test to nail the priest. Therefore, if bail is granted, there is every chance that the accused would influence the girl and her family and it would affect a successful trial,” the prosecution submitted. The court was also informed by the prosecution that the priest was nabbed by police while he was trying to flee to Canada
 
 “The accused would flee from the clutches of law. Therefore, bail should not be granted in the case as the accused is not only influential but may also try to escape a trial,” the prosecution submitted adding that long period of detention was not a ground to grant bail.

 The court observed that despite taking legal recourse, the woman fell prey at the hands of the accused, who married her sister in 2015. 
 
 ""Her (victim's) various police complaints, culminating in registration of four FIRs against the accused, tell tale of the helpless situation of a girl, who despite taking recourse to law and police, fell prey in the hands of the accused, who ultimately succeeded in committing rape with her, despite all her resistance and efforts. 
 
 ""Nothing adverse came out in the cross examination of the prosecutrix so as to show that she was deposing falsely in the court. Her testimony is consistent throughout,"" the judge said. 
 
 The court, which also slapped a fine of Rs 15,000 on the convict, directed the   (DLSA) to pay the victim Rs two lakh compensation considering ""the gravity of the offence, her mental and physical trauma, her social status and financial condition"". 
 
 It noted that ever since the convict got married, he was stalking his wife's sister because of which the couple soon separated. 
 
 According to the prosecution, the man forced the victim to have physical relations with him and threatened to torture her sister (his wife) and kill her father and brother if she refused. 
 
 She lodged several complaints against him, yet he did not mend his ways, the woman told the court, adding that on December 27, 2015 he raped her. 
 
 She lodged an FIR on January 6, 2016 alleging that on several occasions, he had molested her and stalked her following which she lodged various complaints. 
 
 The man, however, denied all the allegations and claimed he was falsely implicated by the victim, adding that he had consensual physical relations with her. 
 
 The court rejected his contentions and sent him behind bars while noting that the woman was threatened and coerced to have physical relation. 
 
 ""The act of making physical relations was under coercion and the consent was not voluntary and it was passive giving in by the prosecutrix on account of inevitable compulsion and clouded by the fear of threats of blackmailing by the accused. 
 
 ""Despite the continuous FIRs against the accused, the accused was not desisting from his act of molesting the prosecutrix and conduct of the accused certainly had a scary impact on the mind of the prosecutrix,"" the court said. AG

The move is the next step in efforts by New York prosecutors to bring the former Tinseltown power broker to trial for alleged sex crimes. 
 
  
  
 He was initially charged last week in what was hailed a landmark for the #MeToo movement, nearly eight months after his career imploded in a blaze of accusations of misconduct. 
 
 ""This indictment brings the defendant another step closer to accountability for the crimes of violence with which he is now charged,"" Manhattan District Attorney   said today. 
 
 ""Our office will try this case not in the press, but in the courtroom where it belongs,"" added Vance, who has been criticized for failing to prosecute Weinstein in a separate case three years ago. ""This investigation remains active and ongoing. We continue to urge additional survivors and others with relevant information to call us,"" he added. 
 
 Weinstein's defence attorney announced earlier today that his client would ""follow the advice of his attorneys"" and not testify before the grand jury, accusing Vance's office of bowing to political pressure. The 66-year-old twice-married father of five has been charged with rape in the first and third degrees, stemming from an attack on a woman in 2013, and a criminal sex act against another woman in 2004. Neither victim was named. 
 
 His lawyer says the rape allegation involves a woman with whom Weinstein ""shared a 10-year consensual sexual relationship that continued for years"" after the alleged 2013 incident. 
 
  also claimed that an indictment was ""inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction."" ""The defendant's recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable. We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence, it will reject these attacks out of hand,"" hit back Vance. 
 
 The former movie mogul posted bail at $1 million cash, surrendered his passport and has been fitted with a GPS monitoring device. 
 
 His career went down in flames in October over sexual assault allegations following, which sparked a sexual harassment reckoning across the United States, in multiple industries.

The girl’s teacher made a call on the number, and the recipient (the 20-year-old accused) disclosed his name. The teacher then told the girl’s father that some wrong act might have been committed on his daughter. This aroused the father’s suspicion who came to know that his daughter was suffering from stomach-ache but had not disclosed it to him. Later, he sent his daughter with his sister to a hospital for medical check-up, where doctors disclosed that she was pregnant.
 
 When he asked the survivor about the entire incident in presence of his sister, the girl disclosed that two months ago, three boys residing in their locality, had committed gang-rape on her in a room constructed in the graveyard, which was in the compound of a temple. They had also threatened her that in case she informed him about the incident to anyone, they would kill her brother. Out of fear, she did not disclose the incident to anyone. Her father then lodged a police complaint on January 18, after which Daresi police registered a case. Police later arrested the three accused, one of whom was a juvenile, and produced a challan against two of them (who were majors) in the court. 
 
 During the trial of the case, both the accused pleaded false implication, with defence claiming that the father of the survivor did not like the fact that she used to talk to one of the accused. Additional public prosecutor for the state however pleaded for punishment of the accused on the basis of prosecution evidence — including statements of the survivor, her father, aunt (father’s sister), and principal of her school, among others — and documentary evidence. The defence counsel, on the other hand, pleaded that one had never heard of any occurrence of   in the compound of a temple as alleged by the complainant, and had the incident taken place, it might have come to everyone’s knowledge. He said the accused were being falsely implicated. He also contended that the survivor was a smart girl who knew how to use her mobile phone without her father’s knowledge, and her friend used to talk to her boyfriend from her mobile.
 
 The judge said that the fact that the girl kept a mobile without her father’s knowledge was insignificant, and did not refute the fact that the accused had committed rape on the minor.

"‘Inherent male nature, sexual frustration root cause of rapes’",2018-05-28T14:27:26+05:30,"RAJKOT: An overwhelming majority of young girls in   strongly feel that ‘inherent male nature’ and ‘sexual frustration’ among men is the prime reason behind the rise in brutal rape cases in the country. In fact, even young boys agree that ‘sexual frustration’ mostly leads to sexual assault on women. 

  
  
 This has been revealed in an extensive research titled ‘Rapes In India’ carried out over the past few years by a Rajkot-based woman who graduated from the Trinity University in the US. Nupur Agrawal, born and brought up in Rajkot but now settled in Hong Kong, interviewed 1,000 college-going students (500 girls and as many boys) in the age group of 18-22 to find out the reasons why women are frequently subjected to this trauma. Agrawal took up this study as part of her research in BA psychology and religion, especially because she was shaken by the 2011 Nirbhaya gang rape case of New Delhi.
 
 The students interviewed were from nine major cities. These included New Delhi, Mumbai Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat, Bharuch, Ankleshwar, Anand and Porbandar. She held detailed group discussions and one-to-one interactions with the students. “When the topic of sexual offence was discussed, there were women who were much more vocal and men who remained subdued,” said Agrawal, who is presently working with Chen Yidan Foundation as a researcher and partnership manager. 
 
 A huge majority of women also stated that the men’s desire to prove their masculinity and exercise their dominance over women resulted in rapes. 
 
 Talking to TOI from Hong Kong, she said “It was shocking to find out that our youth still don’t know the definition of rape. Moreover, many youngsters still carry a parochial mindset that women should be accompanied by some family member when goes out at night.”
 
 “I also found that the idea of sex education embarrasses all and the fact that men come to know about woman’s menstrual cycle only after marriage,” she added.
 
 Besides the big cities, Agrawal also interviewed youngsters in small towns like   to learn more about the mentality of youth in India and how Hindu scriptures were being misinterpreted for political purposes after the incidents of rapes. For example, after the Nirbhaya incident, BJP leader   quoted Ramayana citing the story of Sita crossing  . “I have also read the stories of Mahabharata and Ramayana but politicians and religious leaders interpret mythology as per their convenience,” she said.
 
 Talking about the rise in rapes of minors, Agrawal said, “Not only minor girls, but boys too get abused sexually. Even boys should be taught about good touch and bad touch.”

The cops also arrested the accused, 29-year-old Rahul Meshram, on Tuesday, a day after he married another woman. The delay by cops resulted in the 22-year-old survivor failing in her attempt to force the accused to fulfil his promise of marrying her. The accused had exploited the survivor sexually over the last three years by promising marriage. The survivor was desperate enough to consume pesticide since Meshram, who earns livelihood as driver, had exploited her for over three years since January 2016 by promising to marry her. She was also made to undergo abortions on at least two occasions. The survivor had been introduced to Meshram by a relative. Meshram had first exploited her at his residence at Vrundaban Nagar on January 14, 2016. He continued to exploit the survivor till April 22, when she came to know that Meshram had got engaged to another woman on April 4. Despite his engagement, Meshram had taken the survivor and some friends to Pachmarhi in Madhya Pradesh on April 20. The survivor had been exploited at Pachmarhi too, before she happened to see photographs of Meshram’s engagement in the mobile phone. The survivor had immediately approached Nandanvan police station on April 25, with social activist Sunita Thakre. However, cops did not register a complaint since the accused promised to marry the complainant in a joint statement to the cops on April 27. The survivor went to the cops again in May first week, when Meshram threatened her with dire consequences when she confronted him about marriage again. This time the cops had filed only a non-cognizable offence against Meshram for cheating and threatening. Finally, disappointed by the lack of response from the cops, the survivor consumed poison on Monday, a day before Meshram’s marriage with the other woman. She claimed in her statement in hospital that woman sub-inspector M Waghare did not help her. On the contrary, PSI Waghare allegedly tried to dissuade her from following up on her complaint. Senior PI MD Nalawade of Nandanvan police station said that last month the survivor had withdrawn her complaint after reaching a compromise with the accused. “After furnishing a written statement withdrawing her complaint, she later changed her mind and lodged a complaint, which led to the delay,” he said. Apart from Thakre, the survivor was also aided by social workers Neeraj Shinde, Roshan Sadwane and Payal Mankar."

"Father, son among five held for rape, murder of minor girl",2018-05-15T02:45:08+05:30,"GHAZIABAD: A 21-year-old man was arrested on Monday, along with his   and three accomplices for the alleged abduction,   and   of a   girl belonging to Modinagar in January this year. The 15-year-old girl, who was the daughter of a temple priest, had left her home in a huff on December 26 last year after being reprimanded by her mother for possessing a mobile phone gifted to her by a male friend.

 The body of the girl, a student of Class X, was found in a cane field in Partapur area of   on January 12 where the main accused, Sumeet, had disposed it off after murdering her with the help of his accomplices. Sumeet, a hair-dresser who ran a saloon near the girl’s house in Modinagar, had kept her captive in   for 16 days before her murder.
 
 “I had met the girl at the wedding of the sister of a common friend. She had called me to meet her on December 26. She told me she wanted to marry and live with me otherwise she would end her life. I too wanted to marry her. But when cops picked me up for questioning a few days later, I realized that she had other male friends too. She used to talk to them over phone as well. That’s the reason I killed her. My father helped me in the murder in order to save my life. I had kept the girl with me in my home for a day after she came over to live with me. We took her to Partapur on January 10 in a hired car. First we strangulated her with a stole. But since she was still breathing, the driver advised us to run the car over her. All the accused are my friends,” said Sumeet. 
 
 Police have recovered the silver-coloured Delhi-registered Swift car that was used in the murder. The private car had been hired by Sumeet’s father, Ramesh (60), by paying a rent of Rs 1,500 to its driver Sonu. According to police, the girl was strangulated with a stole on the rear seat of the car. The driver Sonu (26) then ran the left rear wheel of the car over the girl’s chest.
 
 According to police, the girl had been kept captive in Vijay Nagar from December 27 to January 10 in the house of Sumeet’s friend Rajiv (26), who worked as a cleaner in a Noida-based call centre.
 
 “After leaving her house on December 26, the girl called up Sumeet from a public phone booth. Sumeet arrived to meet her on a bike along with another friend Arif. The three roamed around in Modinagar area on the motorcycle for the entire day on December 26. They also went to Arif’s house in Niwadi. The same night, Sumeet took the girl to his own house in Niwadi. Sumeet has told police during interrogation that he had a physical relationship with the girl on the night of December 26. The next day, he took her to Rajiv’s house in Vijay Nagar. He requested Rajiv to provide sanctuary to the girl for a few days before he married her,” said SSP Vaibhav Krishna.
 
 However, Rajiv’s wife grew suspicious and began raising objections when Sumeet did not return to fetch the girl even after a fortnight. Police said Sumeet and his father hatched a plan to eliminate the girl after pressure was mounted on suspects for her recovery.
 
 “The motive behind killing the girl was the fear that Sumeet would be caught by police the moment they let the girl free. There was a law and order problem in Modinagar after the girl went missing, as a result of which police had intensified their search. All the five accused namely Sumeet, Ramesh, Rajiv, Arif and driver Sonu had accompanied the girl to Partapur where they killed her. They had also crushed her face with a stone. The girl had not been sexually assaulted by anyone else other than Sumeet,” said Krishna.
 
 A post-mortem was conducted on January 13. The girl’s mother had thrashed her on December 25 after being informed by her tutor that she had been using a mobile phone during classes. The girl had destroyed the SIM card of the phone before leaving her house the following day. Police had initially registered a case pertaining to kidnap in Modinagar police station on December 27. Subsequently, sections of the IPC pertaining to murder, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and rape were added to the FIR along with relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012.

Supreme Court approves scheme to grant compensation to rape & acid attack victims,2018-05-11T18:51:18+05:30,"NEW DELHI: Paving the way for grant of much needed financial support to poor victims of sexual assault and acid attack, the   on Friday approved a scheme for mandatory grant of compensation to them under which a gangrape victim will be paid upto Rs 10 lakh.

 
 A bench of Justices   and Deepak Gupta said the scheme would be enforced in all states and   and directed the Centre to forward it to all governments. The scheme has been prepared by National Legal Services Authority(NALSA) in consultation with Centre.
 
 The monetary relief granted under the “Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other crimes” is not linked with the trial in such cases and the victim can approach the State or District Legal Services Authority for compensation immediately after the incident. The scheme empowers legal services authority to take suo motu cognizance of cases of sexual assault and acid attack to grant interim relief to victims.
 
 Under the scheme, a compensation fund will be set up and it would be managed by State Legal Services Authority(SLSA). It also envisages setting up a portal for victims to apply for compensation online. The scheme sets out the minimum amount as relief for gang rape, rape and acid attack cases.
 
 As per the scheme, a minimum Rs 5 lakh is to be paid in case of loss of life or gangrape of a victim and maximum has been fixed at Rs 10 lakh. A minimum amount of Rs 4 lakh is to be paid in case of rape or unnatural sexual assault. In case of victims of burning and acid attacks, the minimum compensation will be Rs 7 lakh for total disfigurement and Rs 5 lakh in case of 50% burns. It says that Rs 1 lakh shall be paid within 15 days to an acid attack victim and thereafter Rs 2 lakh within two months.
 
 Alleging that the Centre was not releasing money under   to states, senior advocate Indira Jaising pleaded the bench to direct the Centre to directly release fund in favour of SLSA which would grant the compensation to victims. “The Centre is sitting over Rs 3,500 crore   fund, and has so far released money only to nine states. Only 123 victims have been compensated from the fund so far. The court should direct the Centre to directly release the money to SLSA for timely reimbursement of compensation,” she contended.
 
 Additional solicitor general Pinki Anand, however, refuted the allegation and informed the bench that Rs 960 crore from Nirbhaya fund had so far been disbursed.

 Soon, it became very regular. The survivor spoke to her mother-in-law who did not take any action. She was not allowed to speak to any of her relatives too.
 
 The survivor had two miscarriages — towards end of 2016 and then in 2017, following which Rajdatta even took her to the government hospital for a diagnosis.

CBI confirms rape charge against Unnao MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar,2018-05-12T11:44:04+05:30,"NEW DELHI: The   probe in the politically sensitive   gang-rape case has corroborated the survivor’s charge that BJP MLA   raped her at his home in Uttar Pradesh’s Makhi village on June 4 last year while his female accomplice, Shashi Singh, stood guard outside the room.

 
 Sources said while the survivor had consistently named Sengar, MLA from Bangarmau, UP, among those who violated her, local police kept the MLA and some other accused out of the FIR filed on June 20 as well as the chargesheet filed later.
 
 The central agency has recorded the survivor’s statement before a magistrate under CrPC Section 164, in which she “stood by” the allegations. Statements recorded under CrPC Section 164 are admissible in court as evidence.
 
 
  
  
 
 The police, a CBI officer said, also delayed the girl’s medical examination and didn’t send the vaginal swab or her clothes to the forensic laboratory. “This was all deliberate and in connivance with the accused persons,” he added.
 
 Sengar, Shashi Singh and the other accused, who were arrested by the CBI on April 13-14, were questioned at length and the agency is tying up the loose ends related to the police’s involvement in saving the MLA.
 
 The UP government had handed over the case to the CBI following an uproar over the alleged effort by the Unnao police to save the BJP MLA.
 
 Describing the sequence of events in 2017, as established by the CBI based on the survivor’s statement and independent investigation, an agency source said, “The girl was raped on June 4 by the MLA after she was brought to his house by Shashi Singh on the pretext of providing her a job. Between June 4 and June 10, the girl didn’t speak as she had been threatened. On June 11, she was abducted by three persons — Shubham Singh, Awadh Narayan and Brijesh Yadav. From June 11 till 19, the girl was kept mostly in an SUV and repeatedly gang-raped by these three while on the move.”
 
 When the girl was finally found on June 20, some officers at the local police station in Makhi (Unnao) were “reluctant” to register an FIR. When they eventually registered one, they left out Sengar, Shashi Singh and a few others from it.
 
 Again, when a chargesheet was filed in August, the police named only the three men — Shubham, who is Shashi Singh’s son, Awadh and Brijesh.
 
 “So, the UP police were right in claiming that the names of the MLA and Shashi Singh were not there in the FIR filed by the girl on June 20. But what it did not disclose was that the survivor’s complaint was diluted by UP police,” the CBI source said.
 
 The UP police acted only recently, when state DGP O P Singh ordered the suspension of the deputy superintendent of police, the local SHO and four constables. The CBI is investigating the role of the DSP, SHO and others at the police station.
 
 
 
 
 Reacting to TOI’s report on Friday that the CBI probe had found the involvement of BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in the alleged rape of a girl from Makhi village in Unnao, the CBI said it had not concluded its probe in the case. CBI spokesperson Abhishek Dayal said in a statement, ""In response to media queries related to a news item published today in a national daily, it is stated that investigation in three cases relating to certain incidents including alleged rape, violence etc in Unnao district (Uttar Pradesh) is still continuing.""
 
 CBI has not given any update/conclusion/views with respect to the cases to any mediaperson. All such stories related to said cases published/broadcast in the media recently are purely speculative.” TOI stands by its report in which it has nowhere been mentioned that the probe has been concluded.

 “We are going to Delhi on May 9 to attend a programme for which we have been invited by IUML. The next day we may also meet Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia. If we meet them, we will certainly demand justice. We have doubts regarding the probe in the case since Kuldeep Sengar belongs to the party which is power both at the Centre and state,” the rape survivor’s uncle told TOI on Monday.
 
 “Why Kuldeep Sengar has not been shunted out of the BJP? The BJP is trying to save its rape-tainted MLA and this is the reason why Kuldeep has not been removed from the party. Till date no one from the party has come to meet the girl (rape survivor) or us to motivate us and ensure that we get justice,” he added.
 
 “If I tell my nieces (including the survivor) that I wish to go to Delhi to take care of my business, they express fear and sink in grief. Now their father is also not in the world. As they feel that they are not safe in Unnao, I am staying back and will fight for justice,” he said.

Pathankot lawyers have mixed views on Kathua rape-murder case,2018-05-09T07:29:22+05:30,"PATHANKOT: While the bar in district court Pathankot, which has come into limelight after the Supreme Court shifted the criminal trial of Kathua rape-murder case here, is unequivocally in favour of punishing those involved in gruesome rape and killing of eight-years-old nomad girl, some of its members have divergent views regarding the findings of the police investigation in the case.

 
 On Monday, teh apex court had shifted the trial of the case to Pathankot, around 26km from Kathua that had witnessed mass protests and triggered political crisis in the state over the investigation report of Jammu and Kashmir police. The trial of the case would now begin at the district court Pathankot as soon as the complete records of the case are shifted here from Jammu and Kashmir.
 
 On Tuesday, TOI visited the Pathankot district bar association — youngest bar body of Punjab with around 320 members — to take an account of the sentiments of its members on the issue. Pathankot was upgraded to district and sessions court in 2013. Earlier, it was under district and sessions court Gurdaspur.
 
 Former president of Pathankot   Ashok Parashar said they had full sympathy with victim but   should have conducted a probe in the matter to investigate some aspects of the case as demanded by the accused. “We respect the SC verdict and would extend full cooperation during trial,” he said.
 
 DBA former secretary Shrikant Sharma said the rape and murder of a minor was a heinous crime but what was the harm in having a CBI probe to ensure that no innocent was implicated in the case.
 
 An active bar member Vinod Kumar Mahajan was of the view that an opportunity of fair probe should have been given in the case, especially when the accused were also demanding CBI probe.
 
 Finance secretary of the bar Vijay Abrol said if there was so much resentment against the police probe, the matter should also have been probed by an independent agency to ensure no innocent was framed in the case. “But we are hopeful that a fair trial at Pathankot would bring truth of this curious case,” Abrol said.
 
 Some of the office-bearers of DBA, however, remained evasive while making any comment of the issue and said the bar would ensure smooth trial at Pathankot.
 
 Bar president Rachpal Singh Thakur told TOI that members might have personal opinions but the Pathankot lawyers’ body had no connection with the Jammu Bar Association and would ensure the trial was completed here in a free and fair manner. “Our endeavour would be that no innocent is punished in the case. We would extend all kind of help to all the parties,” Thakur added.
 
 Raman Puri, another veteran member, said they came to know about the alleged false implications of some accused in the case through media and thus, they had no personal sentiments attached to any party.
 
 Bhanu Pratap Shukla, a young DBA member, said they were happy that the apex court had considered Pathankot to decide the case. “Our collective responsibility at the bar would be to ensure the rule of law prevails,” Shukla added.

 ""A fresh petition seeking a CBI probe is ready. It shall be filed within a few days (in the Supreme Court),"" Ankur Sharma, the lawyer of five of the accused in the case, said today.
 
 A detailed counter on behalf of accused Sanjhi Ram, Vishal Jangotra and Parvesh Kumar was filed in the apex court, along with an additional affidavit seeking a CBI probe, he added.
 
 Sharma said in yesterday's hearing, only a notice could have been issued if a fresh petition seeking a CBI probe was filed.
 
 ""The fastest way of getting a CBI probe in yesterday's hearing was through our counter and additional affidavit,"" he said, adding that their main concern was not the shifting of the case, but the CBI probe.
 
 The lawyer denied that yesterday's court order, shifting the trial of the case to Pathankot, was a setback for them.
 
 ""It was a loss for the state government as it wanted the case to remain in Jammu and Kashmir, preferably in Ramban district,"" he said, adding that it was a loss for the victim's family also as it had wanted the case to be shifted to Chandigarh.
 
 ""The court has called for a fast trial of the case on a day-to-day basis. We are hopeful that the trial will be completed in a year,"" Sharma said.
 
 The state government's ""plot"" of introducing 221 witnesses to cause a delay in the trial was busted by the apex court, he said, adding that the case would now be heard on a daily basis.
 
 ""We are hopeful that the case will be transferred to the CBI,"" Sharma said.
 
 The body of the eight-year-old victim was recovered from a forest area in Kathua on January 17, a week after she had gone missing while grazing horses in the area.
 
 The Jammu and Kashmir government had handed over the case to the crime branch, which had formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe it.

 The accused, Sudam Ganpat  , who was on bail since April 25, 2016, was taken into custody and sent to   soon after special judge S H Gwalani pronounced the judgment. 
 
 ""The accused cannot be shown any leniency,"" the judge said. ""Crimes on girl child are increasingly constantly throughout the country and it appears that the enactment of new law has not made any change in the situation. If the accused is dealt with leniently, a wrong message will be sent to the society. Gullible minor girls, in particular, would not feel safe even in their school bus, as happened in the present case,"" the court said. 
 
 The court convicted Nimhan for offences under Sections 4 and 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code. A six-month jail was also pronounced for the offence of criminal intimidation. 
 
 Special public prosecutor   examined nine witnesses in support of the prosecution’s case. Nimhan had claimed false implication for having warned the survivor about complaining to her teacher for quarrelling with other students in the school bus and throwing colours and water balloons on students and bystanders. 
 
 Judge Gwalani observed that the victim had denied such a suggestion in her cross-examination and there was no explanation from the accused as to why he did not complain to her teacher and parents.
 
 “It is also highly improbable that victim student with the help of her mother, teacher and friend would implicate the accused in such heinous offence. No prudent lady would put the future of her tender aged daughter at stake only at the instance of her daughter and her friend,” the judge said. “Evidence of victim in respect of sexual assault and criminal intimidation by accused is well corroborated by evidence of her mother, teacher and her friend. These four witnesses proved about sexual assault on the victim by the accused,” the judge held.

 The survivor’s parents had hired services of a private school bus for ferrying their daughter to and from school.

 The girl’s family searched for her all night. At 7.10am, a newspaper vendor found her lying unconscious, smeared in blood in an alleyway separating two apartment complexes in Golf Gardens.
 
 The girl’s maternal uncle said, “She would go to school in the morning, return at 4pm and then leave for tuitions and return between 7pm and 7.30pm. That was the routine. But on enquiring with her friends, I came to know that she had not attended school or been to the tuition class. A few girls told me she had been bunking school for a the past couple of days and hanging out with a youth who had introduced himself as a studio technician working in an ad agency. I managed to track down the address of the agency located in Golf Green. On speaking to the employees, I found one of them being evasive and misleading.

 Murder cases, meanwhile, showed a marginal rise from 144 to 146 in the same time period. While cases of robbery dipped from 990 to 857 this year, kidnapping for ransom went up in the corresponding period.
 
 
  
 
 Fatal accidents, which had shown a dip   year, saw a sharp rise from 412 to 440 this year. Police officers said that most of it was due to changes in road geometries and measures to prevent jaywalking, especially on national highways and radial roads like Ring Road. Almost half of the cases were found to be hit and runs.
 
 According to the police, more cases of rape are being reported after campaigns for women safety have increased in the past few months. It was found that in 95% of cases, the accused was known to the survivor.
 
 Eight cases of kidnapping for ransom were reported this year against six till April 15th last year. Snatching cases, however, dipped to 1,826 from 2,544 in 2017.

In most rape cases, police fail to send samples to   for either serological examination or DNA fingerprinting. 

  Dr G Pandu said, the lab that serves both Telugu states received samples in at least 1,000 rape cases for serological examination in a year, whereas only 300 tested positive for semen. 
 
 In Telangana, according to   around 1,200 rape cases are reported every year and 1,000  .
 
 Speaking to TOI, FSL expert Dr G Pandu said, ""After serological examination, if it turns positive for semen presence, we take up DNA fingerprinting. Delay and defective methods adopted in collection, result in serological examination turning negative for presence of semen. Recently, we extracted DNA samples from a woman's body even 12 hours after it was dumped in a well at Vizianagaram. Semen was not affected as the body did not decompose and it was inside the genital cavity."" 
 
 Dr M Narayana Reddy, a forensic professor told TOI, ""Police have to take blame for delay in taking rape survivors to the nearest hospital for medical examination. If victims are kids they go to toilet and clean up. Doctors who collect samples at hospitals often fail to take precautions. They need to be trained by experts from CDFD and FSL. Sterile swabs have to be used to collect samples and dried. The medical officer collecting swabs should wear gloves and cover his mouth.

Mom of Mumbai teen rape survivor wants baby to be delivered,2018-05-08T04:37:08+05:30,"MUMBAI: In an interesting turn in the hearing of a plea by a 16-year-old rape survivor from   to abort her 24-week pregnancy, her mother on Monday told the   the baby must be delivered. 

 “I want the child to be born. I shall give the child for adoption,” the mother told a vacation bench of Justices Anil Menon and Bharati Dangre. 
 
 The court heard a petition by the minor, filed through her mother, for the termination of her pregnancy, which is beyond the legally permissible 20-week ceiling. She was raped by a relative. On May 4, the court constituted a medical team of doctors from   for their opinion on if it was safe to terminate the pregnancy. 
 
 When the matter came up for hearing, finding a technical glitch in the petition, the judges summoned the survivor’s mother to ascertain if she was aware of what is stated in it. 
 
 While Rajawadi’s medical board favoured medical termination of pregnancy (MTP), two doctors said it would be better if MTP was done by a tertiary hospital like KEM, better equipped to handle an emergency. So, the judges summoned doctors from KEM “not wanting a situation where there is any hitch” in the MTP operation. 
 
 The mother told the court she was aware that the petition was filed for termination of pregnancy. A KEM doctor said there was no issue in getting MTP done. But the doctor was asked to take the survivor’s mother aside and explain to her the risks of an MTP procedure. Thereafter, when quizzed by the judges, the mother said she wanted the baby to be delivered. The judges were taken aback. 
 
 “You moved court to get the child aborted? You signed the petition,” said Justice Menon. 
 
 The judges said the survivor’s mother has not made up her mind. “The picture is completely different. In the morning we would have not known. Good we called her to court!” said Justice Menon. The survivor’s advocate, Meenaz Kakalia, said, “She is confused. Two different pictures have been given by two sets of doctors.” 
 
 The judges said the survivor’s mother is petrified of the consequences. “It is not possible to push her into this. Let her think about it. Our prime consideration is the safety and health of the child (survivor),” said Justice Menon. The bench has given the woman a day to decide and asked her to talk to the medical social worker of Rajawadi on Tuesday. Posting the matter for May 9, the judges also asked that Kakalia, the doctors and social workers form a team. “You have to guide her. She is not in a position to take a call,” said Justice Dangre.

 “As and when a department closes, we will lock it up. The neurology department, for instance, shuts by 1pm, so after that, it will be locked. Also, additional gates will be put up to restrict access to these areas and security personnel will be given orders accordingly. They will be instructed to hand over the keys to the resident medical officer (RMO),” OGH superintendent Dr B Nagender told TOI. With staff and other workers at the hospital familiar with isolated pockets, management hopes that the move would prevent such incidents.
 
 The latest decision is significant because at least three-five domestic violence victims turn up at OGH every day for treatment. In most cases, sources say, the women come to the hospital alone, making them vulnerable to sexual assaults.
 
  president Mujtaba Hasan Askari said, “Although enhancing security and CCTV cameras are important; the hospital must have counselling facilities both for the patient as well as family members.”
 
 Also, while restricting access to ‘blind spots’ like the OP block where the incident occurred is pertinent, doctors say that a dormitory-like set up for housing such patients must be created to ensure safety.

"​Supreme Court shifts Kathua rape trial to Pathankot, orders day-to-day hearing",2018-05-08T04:49:54+05:30,"NEW DELHI: In a bid to halt attempts to polarise and politicise the   rape-murder, the Supreme Court on Monday shifted the trial outside Jammu and Kashmir to   in Punjab, ordered day to day in-camera proceedings and said it would continue to monitor progress of the case. 

 Accusing Kathua bar association members of attempting to prevent police from filing the chargesheet, advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for the eight-year-old victim’s father, appealed to the SC to protect fair trial in the case from being buried. She suggested that the trial be shifted outside the state to Chandigarh or any place where witnesses could be protected from being influenced or intimidated to turn hostile.
 
 J&K fielded senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, advocate general Jahangir Iqbal Ganai and standing counsel M Shoeb Alam to oppose shifting the trial outside the state and during arguments the state suggested Udhampur, Jammu, Samba and Ramban as alternatives.
 
 Jaising said except Ramban, no other place was acceptable to the victim’s family. But counsel for the accused — Harvinder Chowdhury, Geeta Luthra, Meenakshi Arora — and PIL petitioner Anuja Kapur protested loudly and said Ramban had a reverse communal polarisation and was plagued by insurgency.
 
 The bench zeroed in on Pathankot keeping in view its proximity to Kathua. The bench issued a series of directions to the J&K government while maintaining the state’s role as the prosecutor in the case and ordered that the trial be conducted as per Ranbir Penal Code (RPC).
 
 While ordering transfer of all case documents to the Pathankot district and sessions judge, who was asked to hold the trial himself and not assign the case to any additional district and sessions judge, the bench allowed J&K government to appoint the public prosecutor and provide translators to the Pathankot court for translating documents from Urdu to English.
 
 Asking the   government to take proper care of witnesses, the bench said the concept of fair trial is sacrosanct and included the accused in its ambit. “The accused persons shall also be similarly treated so that they do not feel that solely because they are accused persons, they are presumed to be guilty, for it is a settled principle that they are innocent till they are found guilty,” the bench said.
 
 “Fair trial commands that there has to be a free atmosphere where the victims, the accused and the witnesses feel safe,” the bench added. It said concept of fair trial included speedy trial as well.

 The court also took into consideration that the 16 years old complainant had consented to physical relationship with the accused, son of her maternal uncle, despite being fully aware of the fact that he was engaged to her cousin sister.
 
 A division bench comprising justices   and Murlidhar Giratkar, however, upheld Pradip Bawane’s conviction under Section 417 of IPC for cheating and awarded six months of imprisonment to him. He was also slapped with a fine of Rs50,000 that would be deposited with the Chandrapur Sessions court registry. It was told to keep the amount for six years and after its maturity, it would be handed over to the survivor for future needs of her child.
 
 On October 25 last year, the trial court convicted   under Sections 376 and 417 of the IPC and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for life on first count and one year on second count. The HC, however asked the jail authorities to release him as he had already undergone the required term.
 
 The incident dated back to December 2010, when the accused took the complainant to his home for doing household work, as both his sisters were pregnant and were staying with him. One day, when she was alone at home, Bawane allegedly forced himself on her. He also threatened her that he would commit suicide if she revealed anything outside. His misdeeds continued for about three weeks despite warning by the girl that she would conceive. He promised her that he would break his engagement with her cousin sister and marry her.

 Subsequently, a charge sheet was filed and the Chandrapur court found him guilty of rape and cheating, which he challenged in the HC through counsel Rajendra Daga.

In view of the Supreme Court’s rulings, sexual intercourse with the survivor’s consent doesn’t amount to rape. The trial court wrongly convicted the accused for offence punishable under Section 376. Though the prosecution failed to prove rape, it proved that the accused cheated the prosecutrix by not performing marriage with her,” the HC said.

"Centre, NALSA fix compensation for rape, acid attack victims",2018-05-11T01:17:40+05:30,"NEW DELHI: Coming to the aid of poor women who face financial hardship after dehumanising sexual assault or a severe trauma like an  , the   ( ) in consultation with the Centre has drawn up a relief policy offering minimum amount of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7 lakh respectively.

 
 NALSA’s comprehensive scheme sets out the minimum amount as relief for gang rape and  . The “compensation scheme for women victims/survivors of sexual assault/other crimes” has been prepared on an order of the apex court that sought ‘model rules’ to provide succour to women victims and their family members, particularly the poor and residents of rural areas lacking resources to fight legal battles. 
 
 As per the scheme, a minimum Rs 5 lakh is to be paid in case of loss of life or gang rape of a victim and maximum has been fixed at Rs 10 lakh. A minimum amount of Rs 4 lakh is to be paid in case of rape or unnatural sexual assault. For the loss of any limb or part of the body resulting in 80% of permanent disability, Rs 2 lakh is to be given and Rs 2 lakh in case of grievous physical injury. The scheme is binding on all states.
  
  
 For loss of foetus or miscarriage, minimum compensation is Rs 2 lakh. Interestingly, the scheme says that if a woman victim is covered under more categories of the schedule, she shall be entitled for the total value of compensation. If a gang rape victim dies, her family members would be entitled for a minimum Rs 10 lakh — Rs 5 lakh for loss of life and Rs 5 lakh for the offence of gang rape.
 
 At present, different state governments grant varying amounts to rape survivors ranging from minimum Rs 10,000 in Odisha to Rs 10 lakh in Goa. Maharashtra is the only state which has not framed rules. As the amount of compensation varies in different states, a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta on Thursday approved the scheme in principle.
 
 “Victims in different states cannot be compensated differently. It makes no difference where the victim has been raped. The amount of compensation must be the same across the country,” the bench said. It also said that maximum compensation would not be capped and the state government would be at liberty to pay more to the victims beyond the minimum amount fixed under the scheme.
 
 In case of victims of burning and acid attacks, the minimum compensation will be Rs 7 lakh for total disfigurement and Rs 5 lakh in case of 50% burns. It says that Rs 1 lakh shall be paid within 15 days to an acid attack victim and thereafter Rs 2 lakh within two months.
 
 The compensation granted to a minor victim will be 50% higher than the above fixed amount.

Rehab owner arrested for raping 15-year-old inmate,2018-05-11T06:49:26+05:30,"Kolkata: A 15-year-old girl undergoing treatment for drug and alcohol abuse at a rehabilitation centre near Tollygunge was allegedly raped by the centre’s owner for three days in a row. The incident comes within days of a youth being beaten to death at another   centre in Sonarpur.

  
  
 
 The owner of the facility near Tollygunge was arrested late on Wednesday and charged under the stringent Pocso Act after the girl’s parents, who had got her admitted to the rehab, lodged an FIR. The rehab centre has officially denied all allegations and said they would contest the matter in court.
 
 The girl, who lives in a municipality area near Kolkata and studies at a prominent English medium school, had been admitted to the rehab on January 16. Her relatives said it was bouts of violent behaviour and her alcohol and drug abuse that worried her parents. Her father is in the insurance sector and her mother has a small business running from home.
 
 The rehab centre, Behala  , has been in operation for four years. Functioning out of a rented house in Muchipara, it is around 3km from the Tollygunge Metro station. According to the rules, the family had access to the girl only once a month. Accordingly, her parents had visited her only thrice before.
 
 The parents had dropped in for a visit on Wednesday, when the girl told them that owner Sanjay Pal, 42, had repeatedly raped her for three days. They lodged an FIR at Behala police station. Pal was arrested at 11pm, and the traumatised girl shifted to a government shelter.
 
 
 
 
 According to the police, the centre had initially been started by two persons. One of them quit and set up another centre in Howrah.
 
 At present, Behala Suraksha Foundation has 56 inmates, seven of whom are female. Neighbours claimed that though the centre admitted females patients, there were no women staff or nurse to attend to them.
 
 The only women around, apart from the inmates, are front office staff. “We often hear screams from inmates. I wouldn’t be surprised if they are regularly beaten up,” said an immediate neighbour.
 
 Relatives of two other inmates said they had a lurking suspicion that something was amiss. “Admission to the centre does not require a doctor’s prescription or advice. I admitted my father a monthand-a-half ago to rid him of alcoholism after doctors at the local Vidyasagar Hospital could not convince him to quit. What we found strange is that they never allowed us beyond the drawing room. I also didn’t see any trained nurse around,” said Nisha Sardar.
 
 Pinky Das, a committee member of the rehab unit, denied all allegations. “It is a concocted case. We will fight it in court,” she said. Proclaiming Pal’s innocence, she alleged the girl who had accused Pal was a psychiatric patient who was also a sex addict.
 
 
 could not contact her psychiatrist to verify the claim. Das further alleged that the girl had framed Pal because she had not been allowed to go home as she had been demanding. “She is undergoing a six-month treatment. But since the past month, she has been insisting she be allowed to return home. Since her pleas were turned down, she took revenge by making this false accusation,” Das said.

Rajasthan: Man detained for raping minor daughters for a year,2018-05-11T08:58:40+05:30,"UDAIPUR: In a horrifying tale that has come to light, a man had allegedly been raping his two minor daughters for a year almost every night at their home in Deewan Shah colony under Surajpole police station of the city. The accused’s wife, who had left home four months ago, came to know of the act when she returned home recently and the terrified children narrated their plight to her. The man has been detained, police said.

 
 The Surajpole police took the kids to their home to verify the crime spots on Thursday. Child Welfare Committee ( ) members, a   representative and a member of the women's cell accompanied them.
 
 CWC chairperson Preeti Jain said, “The victims’ statements have been recorded and we have ordered the police station concerned to register a case under the   and arrest the accused father.”
 
 SHO of Surajpole police station Adarsh Kumar said, “On the basis of the complaint, we have detained the accused father and are interrogating him.”
 
 Harish Paliwal, a member of the CWC, said, “We received the complaint through the women's cell where the woman had gone with her daughters aged 11 and 6. We held a counselling session with them in a friendly atmosphere to make them comfortable enough to speak out what they had been bearing for a long time. What the kids narrated was a horrifying account that puts humanity to shame. It is hard to believe that any father could commit such a ghastly act with his own daughters.”
 
 The accused is said to be an alcoholic who would not give a penny to his wife for running the household. The woman did petty jobs to look after her four kids. Tired of his constant abuse and battering, she left home four months ago. The elder daughter told the CWC that even when their mother lived with them, her father would take her away while she would be sleeping with her grandparents and siblings in another room. The girl said the man would take her to a separate room, strip and   her very often. The man allegedly threatened her not to tell this to anyone in the house and so the child endured everything.
 
 After their mother left, the father allegedly started raping even the younger daughter, who is just 6 year old, in the same manner. Both the girls were so afraid of being beaten and abused that they could not muster courage to tell this to their grandparents whom they felt would not believe them, the CWC members said.

The first tale is of a factory girl getting raped inside the work premises and her story of survival. The second tale is of a single mother and her inability to face her own child after the heinous crime on her. The third and the last tale is of a raped married woman and how her husband reacts to it. 
 
  
 “The concept of White came into my mind while I was at   last year and was exposed to a report showing statistics of sexual assaults on women throughout the globe. That was the time when I actually believed that rape is not an issue confining itself to India; women are being treated the same way even in other countries (as per the statistics). We end up talking about the rapists, the victims but hardly anyone speaks about the struggle that the victims suffer from. Hence, I tried to be responsible and show an unspoken side of such assaults. Luckily, I possessed one of the most powerful weapons i.e. the camera,” said Aneek, adding, “India is a country which has one of the highest sexual assault cases most of which go unreported due to shame or due to fear of losing prestige in society; however, this film is about the fight that comes afterwards. Three women leading their lives differently all of a sudden face a heinous truth and try to come out of it in their own unique way.

Let's talk about TEENAGE PREGNANCY: 3 laws every teen must know!,2018-05-18T15:30:09+05:30,"While the US is observing May as its  , India probably is still not doing its part. When it comes to  , the country is still hushing mouths and staying tongue-tied. Sadly, it is not just about the people. You will be dismayed to know that according to the capital L of the country, a sexual encounter of a minor girl, willing or not, is considered sexual assault notwithstanding her choice! To get a clearer account of where the legal provisions stand at present in our country when it comes to teenage pregnancy, we got in touch with  , advocate, Supreme Court of India. Here's the lowdown of what he had to say.

 
 
 
 The problem with the idea of consent is that a woman if not a major is not eligible to give her consent when it comes to sexual activity, says Nipun. The idea of a consenting major is different from the idea of a major. The law changed after the Nirbhaya gangrape case as earlier the age was set at 16, he explained, which was then the age bar for a consenting major. However, the matters got murkier as post that, the age has been revised to 18. ""Even though you may have given your consent for a sexual activity, it will be considered   if you are below 18,"" Nipun said.
 
 
 
 It wasn’t just the idea of consent that witnessed a change. It was also the definition of rape. Earlier, only penetration fell under the definition. “However now, the new law says that any form of sexual contact, fingering, oral sex, etc., will also fall within the definition of rape,” he said.
 
 
 
 If a female is pregnant and she is a minor, then as per the law of Medical Termination of   section 3, sub clause 4, she does not have the right to terminate the foetus, said Nipun. A minor pregnant will need the consent from her legal guardian to be able to get under the knife.
 
 
 
 “However, even this clause gets problematic when we come to the subject of child marriage.” In a step that empowers women, law had decided that marriages in the age frame of 15 to 18 years are considered voidable. This means that the woman holds the right to nullify the marriage when she attains majority,” Nipun explained. However, what about a pregnancy that may ensue in that time? While the age of a consenting female has been raised to 18, the law has not been revised in case of a married minor girl. The Child Marriage Restraint Act has given the right to consent post 16 years to women. So, this two-year discrepancy raises another milieu of problems. 
 
 “Now, even for a married minor girl who gets pregnant and also has the legal right to consent because she is over 16, she can NOT get aborted without the permission of her legal guardian,” Nipun told.
 
 One cannot help but ask how toppled this sense of empowerment is!
 
 
 
 “I think there is one drastic mistake that the law has made, which is the increase in age of consent from 16 years to 18 years. I think when the woman attains the age of 16 years, she is perfectly capable of making her own decision. If you only relegate the law to its former self, that is reduce the age to 16, then the law is fine,” said Nipun.

  The court verdict relied on the DNA test which proved Patel was the father of the child the woman gave birth to, in January 2017.
 
 The continued sexual abuse of the 32-year-old inmate was exposed, when in August 2016 she was found five months pregnant. 
 
 Patel had contended that the deaf, mute and mentally-ill woman had engaged in consensual sex with him. 
 
 In his order, sessions court judge N P   also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the convict and the amount has been ordered to be given to the victim.
 
 The accused had sought acquittal on the ground that there was consent on part of the victim. But the argument was rejected even when he had sought bail. 
 
 If the accused had been granted bail, the victim and the institution would have lost faith in law, said public prosecutor Bharat Patni who had demanded stringent punishment for the accused.
 
 The court had then observed that the issue of consent from the victim is a subject matter of trial. But what was significant was the fact that the victim was in custody of the shelter home, where the accused was working.
 
 While sentencing Patel to rigorous imprisonment, the court observed that looking at the condition of the woman, and the facts that she is deaf, mute and psychologically disturbed, she falls in the most unprivileged class in society. Patel has also shamed the institution said the court. 
 
 Earlier, the management of the Vikas Gruh had approached   high court to seek permission to terminate the pregnancy of the rape survivor. But when the high court called the woman and asked her about her wish, she informed the court that she did not want an abortion.

"Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi: In India, two children are raped, four are sexually abused and eight go missing every hour. Isn’t this a national emergency?",2018-05-26T13:00:00+05:30," needs no introduction — a children’s rights activist, he has relentlessly worked for the cause for two decades with 20,000 organisations across 150 countries. BT caught up with the   (recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize) when he was in Mumbai recently. He spoke about the burning issues of child abuse and rape, and the need for fast-track courts for pending cases under Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). Excerpts...

 
 
 There is a moral epidemic of child sexual abuse in most cities and towns, including Mumbai. These kids are working as child labourers in small-scale industries, domestic helps or are enslaved in prostitution and pornography. The issue requires immediate attention, awareness and action — people should know about the problem. Education, sensitisation and proactive efforts by the society are needed. In cases of child sexual abuse, the victims and survivors are stigmatised and face a lot of problems, while the perpetrators move around freely. Social mobilisation, awareness and the role of parents and teachers are important to safeguard the interest of children in the present situation. The government and its agencies should also be sensitised and trained. They need to prioritise the issues of children in the enforcement of law.
 
 
 
 ‘Khoob ladi mardani woh toh, Jhansi wali rani thi’ is a popular poetry by Subhadra Kumar Chauhan, where Rani Lakshmibai was called ‘mardani’, and that mindset still remains. If a girl is doing something praiseworthy, then she is praised saying, ‘Bahut mardana kaam kiya hai,’ why not janana? When it comes to strength, vigour and intelligence, the work is always attributed to a man. That mindset has to change. Positive masculinity has to be promoted in society.
 
 
 
 I am calling it a national emergency, because two children are raped, four are sexually abused and eight go missing every hour in India — these are government statistics, the National Crime Records Bureau’s data. The reality is perhaps much more bitter and bigger.
 Children do not speak out in most cases. In 70 to 80 per cent of cases, the perpetrator is a relative, uncle, neighbours or a known person. If this isn’t a national emergency, then what is? Far more proactive and robust efforts are needed to deal with this kind of emergency. We recently marched 12,000 kms across the country and around 1.2 million people physically joined me during this long march.
 I just have one question to ask in schools, colleges, courts, and to judges and police officers, ‘Can you sit in peace when your daughter comes home late at night?’ Ladki thoda late se ghar aayegi toh panic ho jayega. If her phone battery is down, the family goes crazy with worry. Irrespective of whether you are a politician, judge or a police officer, Bharat mein kaunsa parivaar aisa hai jo keh sake ki unki betiyaan surakshit hain? This is a national emergency.
 
 
 
 Sensitisation, involvement and accountability of all the stakeholders and sections of the society — right from the judiciary, police, corporates, NGOs and most importantly, institutions of faith — are essential.
 Religious leaders should come together to speak, kyunki unki baaton ka jyada asar hota hai. When institutions of faith denounce sexual abuse and rape, and condemn it as an act of sin and oust the predators from the community, then it reaches the public. 
 
 
 
 The report highlights the time taken to dispose a case of sexual abuse and rapes of minors in different states. For instance, states like Arunachal Pradesh will take over 99 years, while in other states, it could be anywhere between 20-50 years. So, a rape victim today has to wait till she becomes a grandmother and go along with her grandchildren to attend the court hearings. This is a cruel joke on the children of this country. Why should they wait? If any system of governance, judiciary, and society is putting children through these — to get justice, education, freedom and safety, it is a sick society. In 10 different states, we are training the senior police officers and setting up model child-friendly police stations.
 
 
 
 For the first time, in over 100 years, the issues of child labour, abuse and trafficking were being considered by the Nobel Committee. The Nobel Peace Prize had never before been conferred on a cause like this. I was lucky. However, when the Nobel Prize was announced, I was ready because of the global work I’ve done over 20 years. Several prime ministers, former prime ministers and presidents, who are Nobel laureates themselves called me, including  . Later, when we met in an informal set-up, I told him, ‘I am not talking to you as a campaigner, or as an advocate for children. Nor am I talking to a president. I am just talking to a fellow Nobel laureate and appeal to you to support my demand for the inclusion of child slavery, child labour, child trafficking,and violence against children in the SGDs (sustainable development goals).’ And he did not think twice. Later, I met all the key world leaders and they too agreed. The same demand, the same person, but just the Nobel tag helped in changing their listening capacity and understanding. They did not question. I was amazed to see that just one medal could do all this, which I have already given away to the nation (President of India’s Museum).
 So, now in the global development agenda, children and their issues are figuring prominently. That is a major paradigm shift of an issue, from the human right domain to the development domain. It a critical thing that I achieved and I am happy about it.

Alwar police face flak for dismissing gang-rape case,2018-05-26T13:46:26+05:30,"ALWAR: The   police are facing flak over a shoddy investigation in a gang-rape case in which a Deputy SP (DSP) rank officer filed a dubious investigation report dismissing the   allegations, but when the rape survivor became pregnant the probe was handed over to another official who found the allegations to be true.

 According to police, a 25-year-old woman had alleged that she was gang raped by three accused on December 10, 2017 inside her house. She approached the court, following which an FIR was filed in January this year. The investigation was subsequently handed over to Behror DSP  , who in his report concluded that charges were false.
 
 DSP Singh sent his investigation report to an additional SP (ASP) rank officer, who closely examined the report, and found glaring discrepancies including the fact that affidavits of accused attached in the file could not be verified. ASP then informed district SP   about the contradictions in the investigation report.
 
 Around the same time the rape survivor became pregnant and ran pillar to post for justice. After hearing pleas of the survivor, district SP handed over investigation to DSP Bhiwadi, Sidhanth Sharma.
 
 When Sharma re-investigated the matter and spoke to survivor, he found rape allegations were true and three accused were indeed present in survivor’s house on the day when the alleged crime had taken place. Sharma found accused were guilty under section 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 376-D (gang-rape) of the IPC.
 
 The Alwar police said that it is taking the opinion of medical experts to conduct a DNA examination to further ascertain the case. “After re-examination of facts and other evidence, it was established that the trio had raped the woman. The matter is under investigation,” an official said.

Dingerheri rape-murder: Victims’ kin move SC over interim bail to accused,2018-05-29T11:20:50+05:30,"CHANDIGARH: Aggrieved over the interim bail granted by the Punjab and   high court to four persons initially arrested by Haryana police for their alleged involvement in   gang rape, murder and robbery case, the victims’ kin have moved the Supreme court.

 In their appeal filed through senior Congress leaders and advocates   and K T S Tulsi, they said the identification of these accused by the victim itself supersedes any other ocular circumstantial or forensic evidence but HC has overlooked this cardinal rule of the law.
 
 The matter has been fixed for hearing in the first week of July by the apex court.
 
 On March 7, HC had granted bail to four accused — Sandeep, Amarjeet, Karamjeet and Rahul Verma, all residents of Mohammadpur Ahir village of Mewat district. HC granted them bail after CBI filed a charge sheet against four other persons who were members of ‘Axle gang’ for committing the same crime.
 
 CBI had also informed the court that it could not found any evidence against these four accused who were arrested immediately after the incident but their investigation in the matter was still going on. On this, the court ordered their release on interim bail but asked CBI to produce the evidence collected by it against these accused in relation to the case.
 
 The case had hit the national headlines, when on the night of August 24, 2016, a family in Dingerheri village was attacked. While a Muslim couple was killed, several members of their family were injured and a 21-year-old woman and 16-year-old girl from the family were raped.
 
 The case was initially registered on August 25, 2016 by Haryana police. The state police had claimed big success in the case, after the arrest of four local youths within four days of the crime. However, there was resentment among the villagers, who claimed that the arrested youth were not involved in the crime after which the case was sent to CBI for probe.
 
 On September 13, 2017, Gurgaon police had arrested four persons identified as Hemant Chauhan, Ayan Chauhan, Vinay alias Lambu and Jai Bhagwan of ‘Axle gang’. During the CBI probe, these accused have confessed to their involvement in the Dingerheri case and charge sheet was also submitted against them before the special CBI court Panchkula. They are now in the judicial custody.

"Massive outrage over Kathua, Unnao rape incidents",2018-05-29T14:18:46+05:30,"Eight-year-old was grazing the cattle owned by her nomadic Muslim herder family when she was kidnapped. A week later, her raped and mutilated body was found in the woods of   in Jammu and Kashmir. Since the incident came to light less than two days ago, the country has been reeling from shock and outrage. Anger is also building over inaction against the accused in the   rape case, with the Allahabad high court reprimanding the state government for 'collapse of law and order' and the Centre approving a   probe into the case. People from all walks of life — politicians, sportspersons and actors — have spoken out on the horrific crimes and demanded strict action against the culprits. Here's a look at some of the reactions and all the latest developments:

 
 
 
 
 Rahul will hold a candlelight protest at India Gate at midnight today to protest against the Unnao and Kathua rape cases.
 
  
  
 Earlier in the day he had tweeted: ""How can anyone protect the culprits of such evil? What happened in Kathua is a crime against humanity. It cannot go unpunished. What have we become if we allow politics to interfere with such unimaginable brutality perpetrated on an innocent child?""
 
 
 
 
 We have failed her as humans. 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister   announced on Thursday that the state will bring in a law that would make death penalty mandatory for those who rape minors. As national consensus builds seeking exemplary punishment to the culprits, Mehbooba Mufti said: ""I assure that I stand committed not just to ensure justice for the victim but also seek exemplary punishment for those responsible for a crime whose brutal savagery has shamed humanity.
 
 Earlier in the day, Mehbooba Mufti said: The Law will not be obstructed by the irresponsible actions and statements of a group of people. Proper procedures are being followed, investigations are on the fast track and justice will be delivered.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 Justice should be done to her. There shouldn't be politics on that. Criminals who did it have no religion like terrorists have no religion. All communities, Hindu and Muslims have fought for that girl and only disgruntled elements are trying to give wrong message.
 
 
 
 
 
 Kashmir-centric mindset tried to give our agitation for CBI probe a communal colour. They were trying to divide Jammu on communal lines. It is their conspiracy. It was portrayed as if we are against justice for the girl. We demand CBI probe for justice to the minor, and those involved should be punished.
 
 
 
 
 
 No time for 'upavas' dear PM. Speak up: the very soul of womanhood violated at Kathua and Unnao. Was 'Beti Bachao' yet another slogan?
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 It's correct decision to refer the matter to CBI. If there're issues which are not meeting the eye then severe punishment should be given to those who did such an abhorrent act, there should be no false prosecution and accused shouldn't escape.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 Too many BJP supporters seem willing to abandon their tough stand on sexual violence on the basis of religious prejudice. The police allege the girl's rape and murder was part of an effort to drive the Muslim community away from the area. Yet, for the local lawyers and other BJP supporters, the Hindu suspects and the Muslim victim were grounds for blocking prosecution of the case.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Rape accused MPs, MLAs and other lawmakers are a part of this government. Women’s security in our country has become a joke. Shame on the people who tried to stop the victim’s family from getting the justice they deserve. This is unpardonable! 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 The central government today issued a notification directing the CBI to take over the alleged rape case against BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar.
 
 
 
 
 According to it (SIT report), medical officers and police officers, all were hand in glove with the accused to save them and you (state government) acted on this report against those officers but for arresting rape accused you need to do further investigation. If this is the stand you are repeatedly taking, then we will be forced to observe in our order that 'law and order has collapsed in the state'.
 
 
 
 
 
 What has happened is shameful. But to say that no action has been taken is wrong. Actions taken by the police till now will provide a solution and will also set an example for the future.
 
 
 
 
 
 When we say Beti Bachao, we really mean that. We are here to safeguard the interests of our daughters and we are committed to their safety. As far as 
  incident is concerned, the law of justice will prevail.
 
 
 
 
 
 From tomorrow, I'll sit on an indefinite hunger strike. The systemic rape of children and the Centre's silence on the matter cannot be tolerated. I shall not touch food till our demands are met. Strict action against rapists within six months, support for the victims of the Unnao and Kathua rape incidents.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 Is this really the kind of country we want to be known as to the world today? If we can’t stand up now for this 8 year old girl regardless of our gender, caste, colour or religion then we don’t stand for anything in this world. Not even humanity... Justice needs to be done for the sake of keeping our faith in the judiciary and the system alive. I really hope and pray justice is done, and soon.
 
 
 
 
 
 We demand that strong punishment should be awarded to all the accused and justice delivered to the victim family. Would really request the government to please have strict rules for such a crime.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Imagine what goes through the mind of an 8 yr old as she is drugged, held captive, gang raped over days and then murdered. If you don’t feel her terror, you are not human. If you don’t demand justice, you belong to nothing.
 
 
 
 
 
 Equal rights/ gender bias/ pay disparity all seem like such distant, first world concerns. Let's begin with addressing the unmentionable horrors of the absence of humanity. The only way forward, if at all, from this blood curdling barbarism is justice. Heartbroken and aghast.
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 All those who wish justice for women should stand up and raise their voices against the rapists and their protectors in Unnao and Kathua.

"Kathua rape and murder case: Those with Kashmir-centric mindset portraying stir for CBI probe communal, says Jammu Bar Association",2018-05-29T14:13:13+05:30,"JAMMU: The   (BAJ) on Thursday alleged that their agitation for a CBI probe into the   rape and murder case to ensure justice for the eight-year-old-victim was being portrayed as communal by those with a "" "".

 Batting strongly for justice for the victim, the BAJ claimed that the probe by the crime branch of Jammu and Kashmir Police was done on questionable line amid threats and coercion by a team of officers from Kashmir Valley including one who served jail term for alleged rape and murder of a minor.
 
 Yesterday, Jammu city wore a deserted look with all major shopping areas, trading markets and schools closed following a bandh call given by Jammu High Court Bar Association (JHCBA) to protest against the growing illegal presence of Rohingyas and Bangladeshi nationals, while also demanding a CBI probe into the Kathua rape-cum-murder.
 
 Jammu has been tense since the brutal rape and murder of the eight-year-old girl belonging to the nomadic Muslim Bakerwal community. The police have arrested eight people in the case, but the Bar Association has opposed the action alleging ""targeting of minority Dogras"".
 
 Some of the arrested accused belonged to  , a right wing group.
 
 ""Kashmir-centric mindset tried to give our agitation for CBI probe a communal colour. They were trying to divide Jammu on communal lines. It is their conspiracy. It was portrayed as if we are against justice for the girl. We demand CBI probe for justice to the minor, and those involved should be punished,"" BAJ President B S Salathia said at a press conference here.
 
 He said the BAJ, from the very beginning, called for fair and impartial probe to punish the guilty, ""and that is why we demanded a CBI probe"".
 
 On April 9, some lawyers had tried to prevent a police team from filing a charge sheet in the case following which another case was registered on Tuesday against those who obstructed the sleuths.
 
 ""The manner in which investigation was done is questionable, but the matter is in court now. The call for yesterday's bandh was given to basically to address the issues including deportation of Rohingyas and the directive of the tribal affairs department on the direction of the chief minister (regarding encroachments by Gujjars in Jammu),"" Salathia said.
 
 He said the BAJ had told the media repeatedly that yesterday's bandh was not on the Kathua rape-and-murder issue as the case is in court now.
 
 The Bar Association of Jammu still demands a CBI probe as the investigation by the crime branch will ""only benefit the accused in the case and deny justice to the girl"", Salathia said, adding the government cannot order a probe by the central agency as it is up to the court now.
 
 He claimed that the special investigation team that was probing the case constituted officers from Kashmir wing of the crime branch.
 
 Salathia said the manner in which the special investigation team (SIT) was set up by the government, raised ""deep suspicion and fear (in the minds of minority Dogras of the area) that the probe would not be impartial"".
 
 ""Boys were picked up. They were harassed and tortured by the crime branch to give statements before a judge under Section 166 of CrPC,"" he said.
 
 Salathia alleged that a member of the probing team was involved in case of rape and murder of a minor girl in Doda, and was in jail for over one-and-a-half years.
 
 The president of the Bar Association of Jammu said if the government can give hand over the case of rape and murder of two women in Shopian to the CBI on public demand, then in this case too it should have done the same.
 
 On chief minister  's statement that protests cannot stop the probe, Salathia said, now the court will decide and not the chief minister.
 
 He said the bar association will hold a meeting to decide on the next course of action.

"Across India, horror turns to outrage at gang rape and murder of 8-year-old Kathua girl",2018-05-29T14:27:10+05:30,"NEW DELHI: The groundswell of horror against the alleged bid to communalise the gory   and murder of eight-year-old girl in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kathua grew across the country on Thursday as outrage reminiscent of the   protests erupted on social media. 

 
 On a day when junior foreign minister and former Army chief Gen V K Singh spoke forcefully for the hapless victim, J&K deputy CM Nirmal Singh said he had called for an explanation from two BJP colleagues — Lal Singh and Chandar Prakash Ganga — but said they had denied inciting communal passions. The duo have defended those charged, portraying them as victims of an alleged frame-up.
 
 “We have failed Ashifa (sic) as humans. But she will not be denied justice,” Singh tweeted. CM Mehbooba Mufti said her government would enact a law to make rape of minors punishable by death. “We will never ever let another child suffer in this way,” she tweeted. The state government appointed two special public prosecutors, both Sikhs, for the trial.
 
  
  
  
  
 
 Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who had also been at the receiving end of criticism on social media for not speaking up on the issue, broke his silence on Thursday evening. He tweeted, “How can anyone protect the culprits of such evil?”
 
  
 The former Army chief V K Singh’s remarks failed to find support from his BJP colleagues who focused on their day-long plan to attack the opposition for allegedly paralysing Parliament and practising divisive politics.
 
 Those who spoke on the issue, like chief of MP unit of BJP Nandkumar Singh Chauhan, came out strongly in favour of the accused who have already been proclaimed “innocent” by the Jammu Bar Association.
 
  
  
  
 
 Lal Singh and Prakash Chandar Ganga, both ministers in the Mehbooba government, while addressing a rally organised by the Hindu Ekta Manch in Kathua on March 4, allegedly protested against the arrest of a Hindu man accused in the case. They allegedly dismissed as “jungle raj” investigation by the crime branch of J&K police which had submitted a chargesheet detailing the role of each of the accused in the horrific gang rape and murder case.
 
 
  
 
 CM Mehbooba Mufti, however, stood firm and declared that she would not allow protests to let police discharge their responsibility. “The law will not be obstructed by the irresponsible actions and statements of a group of people. Proper procedures are being followed, investigations are on the fast track and justice will be delivered.

 SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said, “We have initiated an investigation into the matter and appropriate action will be taken very soon.”
 
 The woman said that since the accused had been elected as MLA, her life had become miserable. 
 
 “We are a very poor family. Since my father is unemployed, my mother works as maid in houses at Green Park locality. She often took me to help her. In 2012, when I was 16, I used to go Sagar’s house along with my mother. I came in contact with him. He started talking to me and even promised to marry me. He took advantage of me and raped me several times from 2012 to 2014,” she said.
 
 “He has ruined my life completely. Now, nobody will marry me. I tolerated all this hoping that one day he would marry me but now he is threatening to kill my family and me if I approached the police,” the woman said. Notably, June 17 has been fixed for Sagar’s wedding.
 
 Naithani said, “Circle officer Niti Dwivedi has been tasked with the investigation. Dwivedi reached the woman’s house but she was not there. We will take further action in the matter once the investigation report comes.”

Mufti accepts resignations of two BJP ministers who rallied in support of rape accused,2018-05-30T10:19:14+05:30,"SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister   has accepted the resignations of two BJP ministers, who had participated in a rally in support of the people arrested in connection with the rape and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim girl in Kathua, officials said.

 The resignations of   and   were received from BJP state chief Sat Sharma this morning which were immediately accepted and forwarded to Governor N N Vohra for completing the procedural formalities, they said.
 
 With these resignations, the number of ministers in the state government has come down to 22, including nine from the BJP.
 
 There are three vacancies in the council of ministers as the PDP had last month removed its finance minister Haseeb Drabu unceremoniously, they said.
 
 BJP general secretary Ram Madhav, who had held consultations with legislators of the party in Jammu yesterday, had announced the resignations would be forwarded for further action thereby ending a simmering political crisis in the state.
 
 Both Ganga and Singh had participated in a rally on March 1 after the crime branch of Jammu and Kashmir Police had arrested the nephew of a caretaker of a 'Devisthan' (temple) in connection with the kidnapping and rape of the girl.
 
 During investigation, the police arrested the caretaker and alleged he was the mastermind behind the kidnapping, rape and killing of the girl from a nomadic tribe. The police claimed the motive behind the crime was to terrify the nomadic community and drive it out of the village.
 
 The girl was kidnapped on January 10 and her body was found on January 17. During investigation, the crime branch alleged she was drugged and repeatedly raped before being killed by crushing her head with stones.
 
 Both the ministers had maintained yesterday that they had been sent by the party to Kathua to understand the ground situation. The two ministers were present in the rally in support of the rape-accused where the tricolour was also waved.
 
 Madhav had yesterday said, ""That is why they had to resign. During my visit last month here, I made it clear to everyone that in this matter no one speaks and let us allow the investigations to complete.
  
  
 ""Certain amount of discretion should have been maintained. Certainly, there was a lack of discretion. Sometimes a lack of discretion does not tantamount of any guilt...that has led to certain misconceptions about them (two ministers) also, so they decided they will quit as ministers,"" he had responded, when asked about the two ministers having termed the action of the crime branch as ""jungle raj"" and warned police from arresting anyone.
 
 A much-relieved chief minister Mehbooba Mufti thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for defusing the situation and said the unfortunate incident had brought the people of the state and the rest of the country ""together"".
 
 She said a sense of justice had been reinforced in the state and urged ""New Delhi to wake up to the Kashmir cauldron"".
 
 Both the alliance partners- the BJP and the PDP- had separate legislature party meetings in Srinagar and Jammu yesterday to discuss the situation arising out of the polarisation in the state over the rape-cum-murder of the girl.

Kottiyoor rape: Accused priest denied bail again,2018-06-01T08:03:05+05:30,"KOCHI: The high court has, for the second time. declined   accused of raping a minor girl though over a year has passed since the alleged incident took place.

 
 Justice Sunil Thomas declined bail to main accused father Robin alias  , who was the vicar of Neendunokki parish at   under Mananthavadi diocese of Syro Malabar Church. According to the prosecution, the priest had raped the 16 year old when she arrived at church premises to attend computer classes.
 
 The court directed that the investigation team should file the chargesheet within 40 days after completing the probe and the trial in the case should be completed within six months.
 
 In the bail plea, the priest contended that he has been in jail since February last year and trial proceedings have not started yet. In these circumstances, he should be granted bail (by imposing strict conditions, if required), it was said.
 
 Senior public prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy, strongly opposing the bail plea, argued that there was high chance of the accused influencing the rape survivor and her family as they belong to the same denomination of the church. “This is a case where the survivor had initially implicated her father to save the priest. Finally, the baby delivered by the survivor was subjected to DNA test to nail the priest. Therefore, if bail is granted, there is every chance that the accused would influence the girl and her family and it would affect a successful trial,” the prosecution submitted. The court was also informed by the prosecution that the priest was nabbed by police while he was trying to flee to Canada.
 
 “The accused would flee from the clutches of law. Therefore, bail should not be granted in the case as the accused is not only influential but may also try to escape a trial,” the prosecution submitted adding that long period of detention was not a ground to grant bail.

 Also, it was found that the employers had hired the girl as a nanny through the agency, and paid a commission of Rs 40,000 a year. The girl was paid a monthly salary of Rs 3,500 in the first year, and Rs 4,500 in the second year. As per the   labour laws, the minimum wage for 8 hours of service for six days a week is Rs 9,000 a month. Further, employers didn’t get the police verification done for the girl as well as the cook, Mohit, the rape accused, who is still at large.
 
 “The police are not an authority to determine the age. We will tell them the age after medical examinations,” said Goel. The employers too will be booked under sections 19 and 21of POCSO Act if the girl was found to be minor. Also, they will have to pay compensation to the girl as per the minimum wages prescribed by Haryana government, he said.
 
 “We got her age determination test done at the time of the FIR, which suggested she was around 20 years old. However, there are certain tests that can be done only on the orders of the CWC,” said SI Manjusha, investigating officer.
 
 The SCPCR has decided to write to all deputy commissioners to get all maids and servants registered. 
 
 “We will write to DCs by Monday to ensure all RWAs and households register and get police verification done for all domestic staff,” Goel told TOI.

"Unwilling to pay minor rape survivor Rs 3 lakh, government moves HC",2018-06-02T08:12:26+05:30,"AHMEDABAD: A special POCSO court in   last year ordered the state government to pay Rs 3 lakh compensation to a rape survivor, but the girl has not received a penny yet. The government says it can’t pay more than Rs 1 lakh to the victim.

 The state government is not willing to pay the victim Rs 3 lakh and moved   high court against the court’s order. The government insists that it can pay only Rs 1 lakh according to its scheme and the court has no power to order how much it should pay rape survivors.
 
 The case involves a 15-year-old rape survivor from Una in   district. She was sexually assaulted in 2015. In March 2017, a special court held the accused persons guilty and sentenced them to 10-year imprisonment for abduction, rape of the minor and for violation of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The court also ordered the state government to pay compensation of Rs 3 lakh to the rape survivor’s family, under the Victim Compensation Fund Guidelines Schedule-I. The state government did not pay the compensation and in May 2017, wrote to the victim’s father that it would challenge the court’s order, because the compensation ordered is more than the amount fixed under the Gujarat Victim Compensation Scheme, 2016.
 
 The state government moved the HC and urged it to quash the compensation order, stating that it was beyond the scope of the guidelines provided by the state government. The power to fix compensation amount lies with the   (DLSA) only. The POCSO court went beyond the scope of its power in fixing the compensation amount.
 
 Bhavik Samani, the advocate representing the victim’s father in the high court, said that following a   order, the ministry of home affairs issued a notification and made a provision for payment of a minimum compensation of Rs 3 lakh for rape victims. When the HC heard the state government’s arguments, that its norms permit it to pay Rs 1 lakh only, it ordered the government in December 2017 to pay Rs 1 lakh to the victim’s father immediately. The HC also ordered the government to deposit Rs 2 lakh with the HC registry. “It has been six months since HC’s order, but the government has not paid the victim anything,” the lawyer said.

"Girl trafficked from Jharkhand, raped for a year at employer’s home in Gurugram",2018-06-02T10:39:25+05:30,"GURUGRAM: A girl refused to accept the baby she delivered at a city hospital on Thursday, saying the newborn reminded her of the repeated rape and trauma she had suffered since she was trafficked to Gurugram from Gumla ( ) as a minor in November 2016.

 
 The girl, who worked as a nanny at a house in Sector 31, alleged she was raped several times for over a year by a cook, who also worked at her employers’ place. Both the girl and the cook, Mohit Prasad Thakur (27), lived with their employers.
 
 The girl alleged Thakur would rape her whenever he found her alone or their employers would go out. But, she claimed she kept quiet as Thakur had threatened to tarnish her image, which might have cost her the job.
 
 The matter came to light when the employers noticed her baby bump on March 13. She was already 6-7 months into her pregnancy then. When employers questioned her, the girl broke down and confided everything. 
 
 Then, the employers reported the matter to police and an   was filed under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the   at the Women’s police station. Medical examinations were done, which revealed it was too late to terminate the pregnancy.
 
  Mohit had already gone home to Harraiya,  , on leave and never returned. The police are yet to arrest him.
 
 On Thursday morning, she delivered a baby girl at   in Civil Lines. But she has not seen the child since then, hospital officials said. 
 
 “She reminds me of what I suffered,” the traumatised mother told TOI as tears rolled down her cheeks. “I cannot take her to my village (in Gumla) because no one will understand that it was not my fault,” she added.
 
 “We are trying to counsel the girl. At the end of the day, she is the mother. Once the child is sent for adoption, there will be no looking back for the baby or the mother. The victim is in trauma right now and we want to give her some time to decide,” said Rishikant, founder, NGO Shakti Vahini.
 
 Balkrishan Goel, a member of the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said, “If even after the counselling, the survivor refuses to take the child, the baby will be surrendered for adoption.”
 
 Preliminary probe has revealed the girl, originally from Gumla, was brought to Delhi by an agent in November 2016 and later was employed as a nanny at the house in Gurugram. Her parents, who work in brick kilns, and younger sister are in Gumla.
 
 The girl has not spoken to her parents since she moved to Gurugram as they don’t have a mobile phone. She doesn’t know how her family is now and if they are aware of her whereabouts.
 
 Police sources said Naraiyan was suspected to be the main trafficker. He used to run Bharti Maid Bureau in Delhi’s Shakurpur area earlier and was wanted by police since 2013. The girl was, however, brought to Delhi by Deepak from Devi Placement Service in Pitam Pura. The police are investigating if Deepak was an aide of Naraiyan. 
 
 The girl’s ordeal started 5-6 months after she started living with the employers. 
 
 “Mohit had been working at our house since 2013. He would sleep on the second floor and she would sleep on the ground floor with us. He used to rape her when we were all out. We reported the matter to the police as soon as we got to know about it and have been looking after her ever since,” Sapna told TOI.
 
 Shockingly, the cops did not report the matter to the child welfare committee even though the girl was claimed to be a minor, at least at the time when she was raped for the first time.

"Harvey Weinstein pleads not guilty to rape, sex assault charges",2018-06-06T03:37:57+05:30," today pleaded not guilty to rape and sexual assault charges in a New York courtroom, the next step in a high-stakes legal battle that the #MeToo movement hopes will end with the disgraced   mogul behind bars. 

 The 66-year-old producer, whose career imploded in a blaze of accusations of sexual misconduct and abuse from dozens of women that triggered a global reckoning about harassment in the workplace, could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. 
 
 
  
 
 Weinstein, who appeared in court in a dark blazer, jeans and a tie, uttered only a few words at the brief arraignment hearing in Manhattan. He has steadfastly denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex. 
 
 ""Not guilty,"" he said in a barely audible voice when asked for his plea on the three counts he is facing. He also replied ""Yes"" several times as the judge reiterated the conditions of his monitored release. 
 
 Weinstein, the onetime Tinseltown powerbroker whose films earned dozens of Oscars, was charged with rape and another sex crime in New York late last month, nearly eight months after the first public allegations against him surfaced. 
 
 The twice-married father of five has been indicted for allegedly forcing a woman to perform oral sex on him in 2004, and for allegedly raping another at a Manhattan hotel in 2013.
 
 Benjamin Brafman, one of America's most celebrated criminal defense attorneys, did most of the talking for the mogul at his hearing today. 
 
 ""Mr Weinstein is presumed innocent... however reprehensible the crime may be, it is also reprehensible to falsely accuse someone of rape,"" Brafman said. ""We intend to fight this in the courtroom."" Brafman said that the rape complaint came from a woman who had a 10-year affair with Weinstein, but the information was not confirmed. 
 
 The accusation of forced oral sex comes from  , a marketing consultant who, in 2004, was an aspiring actress. She told her story in October to a daily. 
 
 Evans said that Weinstein spoke to her of a possible role as a model on television reality show 'Project Runway'. before forcing her into oral sex.
 
 Since October, nearly 100 women have said they were harassed or sexually abused by Weinstein over a period of more than two decades. 
 
 Salma Hayek, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie are among more than two dozen actresses who say they were sexually harassed by the producer. A few, including Asia Argento and  , say they were raped. 
 
 The #MeToo movement has seen people around the world come forward with cases of sexual mistreatment, leading to the downfall of powerful men across industries, including   winner  . 
 
 Weinstein has reportedly spent months in treatment for sex addiction. His fashion designer wife, Georgina Chapman, has left him. 
 
 Weinstein remains free, having posted USD 1 million bail. He is wearing a GPS monitoring device, and his travel is restricted to the states of New York and Connecticut.
 
 Weinstein already faces a slew of civil lawsuits, is reportedly under federal investigation, and his former studio has filed for bankruptcy. 
 
 He is also under criminal investigation in London and Los Angeles, but the criminal charges in New York were the first to be lodged. 
 
 Last week, three actresses filed a new lawsuit against Weinstein alleging sexual assault. They urged other victims to come forward and join the complaint.  , one of the women filing the class action lawsuit, said she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein during a 2011 meeting to discuss a new marketing tool.

 “Many of them told police they used to find themselves unclothed the next morning and feel pain in lower abdomen.

"In Goa, 92% of rapists are known to the survivor",2018-06-06T08:43:38+05:30,"PANAJI: Goa police on Tuesday said that 92% of rapes in Goa are committed by persons known to the survivor. In the light of a media storm following a spate of publicised crimes against women, director general of police (DGP) Muktesh Chander said that the force doesn’t specify whether the accused persons are Goans or non-Goans.

 
  
  
 
 “An analysis of   cases reported in Goa reveals that about 92% of cases are committed by friends, relatives and other known persons,” said crime branch superintendent of police Karthik Kashyap. “Only in 8% of the cases is rape committed by total strangers.”
 
 Elaborating on the above, Kashyap said that Goa police registered 256 rape cases from 2015 to May 31, 2018. “Of these, 162 of the accused are the survivors’ friends, 26 are relatives, 17 are neighbours, six are fathers, one a brother and 23 are other acquaintances.” He added that in the past threeand-a-half years, only 20 accused persons are strangers to the survivor. These statistics are consistent with the latest statistics of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), which has recorded that in a whopping 95% of rape cases, the accused is known to the survivor.
 
 Kashyap also said that between April 23 to May 31 this year, Goa police only registered seven cases. This, he said, was a 13% decline from last year. Kashyap also said that in Goa, the detection rate of rapes is 93.1%, and for crimes against women in general, it’s 89% — both figures among the highest in the country.
 
 Kashyap said that there are various sociological and criminological factors responsible for rape. “Goa has a substantial migraint and tourist population,” he said. “Crimes committed by them add to the overall crime figures for Goa.”
 
 Enumerating the measures Goa police have taken to empower women, a source said the force has organised selfdefence classes in various schools and colleges. “We have trained over a thousand girls,” he said. Kashyap also said the 1091 helpline was specifically established to address women’s complaints and that PCR vans patrolling towns and villages respond to emergencies in ‘record time’. He added that tourist police, deployed on beaches, respond quickly to incidents involving women. “Police personnel are regularly sensitised to handle crimes against women,” he said. Other measures include women police stations and scientific techniques to solve rape cases.

"22 years on, rapist not sent to jail as he was a minor then",2018-06-06T06:18:43+05:30,"MUMBAI: Twenty-two years after raping a 15-year-old girl, a man has escaped going to jail for his crime as he was days away from turning 18 when he committed it. The Bombay high   on Monday held the accused, now 40, guilty of  , but set aside prison term, giving him the benefit of the   Justice Act. Under the law, he was a minor when he committed the crime though he was just a fortnight away from turning 18 when he raped the girl.

 
 “It is crystal clear that the applicant was juvenile at the time of the incident,” said Justice Prakash Naik. “It is also apparent that he has (now) crossed the age of 18 years and cannot be referred to the juvenile justice board. Although the conviction of the accused is upheld, the sentence imposed upon him is required to be set aside in accordance with the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act.”
 
 The trial court had rejected the accused's plea that he was a juvenile on the grounds that he was above 18 when the FIR was lodged. But as per law, the age of an accused is considered. “The report stands in favour of the accused stating that at the time of the incident, he was below 18,"" said the high court.
 
 The case dates back to 1996, when the girl was barely 15 and was studying in Class VII. According to her complaint, the accused, who was a neighbour, entered her home while her parents were away and raped her saying he loved her and intended to marry her. He continued to sexually assault her whenever she was alone at home. The crime came to light when her parents discovered that she was pregnant. The accused eventually didn’t marry her and she delivered a child in October 1996. In 1998, the trial court found the accused guilty of rape and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment, which was upheld by the sessions court in 2000. The accused filed an appeal, challenging the conviction the same year.
 
 The high court held that there was evidence to prove the rape charge. The court rejected the defence claim that there was implied consent of the girl, pointing out that since she was underage, consent was immaterial. The high court relied on the inquiry report by the sessions court, which pointed out that the accused was born on February 21, 1978 as per documents. The crime was committed between January 30 and February 10, 1996 which meant he was below 18 and therefore a ""juvenile in conflict with law"".
